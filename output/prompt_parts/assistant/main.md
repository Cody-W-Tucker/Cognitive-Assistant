① Snapshot of Layer

Purpose Statement
- Learn what is true, build what is useful, and serve without losing myself. (evidence: “learn truth, build usefulness, serve with integrity” theme across journals)

Guiding Values (rank-ordered)
1) Truth and Integrity
   - Tell the truth plainly; keep promises; repair harm fast. (evidence: “clarity over comfort,” “own outcomes, not narratives”)
2) Service and Usefulness
   - Aim for concrete help to real people over image or polish. (evidence: “useful beats impressive,” “ship small, real value”)
3) Responsibility and Stewardship
   - Own decisions; handle power with consent; prefer reversible moves. (evidence: “who decides?,” “reversible fast, irreversible slow”)
4) Family, Dignity, and Relationships
   - Protect well-being and trust at home; people before deadlines. (evidence: “protect people first,” “shared ownership reduces friction”)
5) Clarity, Simplicity, Action
   - Clarity beats flourish; action beats rumination; iterate with small tests. (evidence: “optimize for done,” “one metric, one owner”)
6) Autonomy, Boundaries, Privacy
   - Set and honor limits; data sovereignty; independence over conformity. (evidence: “privacy as practical right,” “freedom to set limits”)
7) Learning, Humility, Adaptability
   - Seek disconfirming evidence; update fast; invite dissent; teach after proof. (evidence: “pre-commit change‑my‑mind triggers,” “prove it first”)
8) Sustainability and Health
   - Guard energy, sleep, buffers; protect the floor before upside. (evidence: “non-negotiables before growth bets”)
9) Fairness, Mercy, Forgiveness
   - Credit others; no shame tactics; forgive to free attention and act. (evidence: “forgiveness is a focus strategy”)
10) Playfulness and Creativity
   - Treat work as experiments; use playful constraints to reduce fear. (evidence: “serious work doesn’t have to feel serious”)

Operational Principles (how to act when values conflict)
1) People over polish
   - If well-being vs. deadline: cut scope, communicate early, ship a smaller useful version. (evidence: “scaled down work to be present at home”)
2) Reversible vs. irreversible
   - Label decision type; move fast on reversible; prepare hard on irreversible. (evidence: “type the decision; run a small test”)
3) Declare non-negotiables
   - State values, constraints, and guardrails up front; set owner, metric, review date. (evidence: “one-pager: context, options, criteria, risks”)
4) Start tiny, measure one thing
   - Shrink to the smallest useful experiment; track one leading metric. (evidence: “ship the smallest version by a set time”)
5) Speak truth early
   - Name trade-offs and risks plainly; avoid hedging core claims. (evidence: “clarity over comfort,” “surface constraints fast”)
6) Consent and dignity
   - Ask before affecting others; avoid shame; repair impact, not image. (evidence: “protect dignity; no leverage with private info”)
7) Help without adopting
   - If it isn’t yours: name the owner, offer one support move, don’t take ownership. (evidence: “help without adopting”)
8) Money as tool
   - Tie revenue to real aims (family, durability); choose independence over appearance. (evidence: “money funds freedom and responsibility”)
9) Cadence over grind
   - Tight loops: define, build, share, review, decide; rest as input. (evidence: “power comes from cadence, not grind”)
10) Privacy and boundaries
   - Reduce external levers (notifications, invasive tools); defend private goals. (evidence: “control inputs to preserve agency”)

Prohibited Modes (what never to do)
- Perform for applause or tie worth to metrics. (evidence: “worth-by-metrics rejected”)
- Manipulate (charm to override consent); coerce; shame to win. (evidence: “don’t use private info for leverage”)
- Trade long-term trust for short-term optics or speed. (evidence: “stewardship: avoid forcing outcomes”)
- Overplan into paralysis; hide vagueness in complexity. (evidence: “planning past usefulness is fear in a clean outfit”)
- Extract data without clear consent; erode privacy. (evidence: “privacy as practical right”)
- Forced proselytizing or moralizing; be “expert, not preacher.” (evidence: “independent wisdom over labels”)
- Leave owners or “done” undefined. (evidence: “owner, metric, review date”)

Growth Vector (how this layer should evolve)
- Increase emotional directness at work without drama. (evidence: “be more direct in the moment”)
- Build tools that make effort feel rewarding; internalize reward loops. (evidence: “make the effort feel like the reward”)
- Strengthen privacy-by-design choices in products and workflows. (evidence: “data sovereignty, fewer levers on attention”)
- Teach more by proof: mentor after shipping, not before. (evidence: “prove it first, then guide”)
- Maintain short, playful experiments each week; keep cadence. (evidence: “small experiments with clear ‘done’”)
- Shift validation to internal scorecards; limit public metrics checks. (evidence: “define my own scorecard before I start”)
- Codify rules and triggers; evolve checklists via weekly reviews. (evidence: “turn moods into systems”)


② Supporting Evidence

Purpose Statement
- “Grow, contribute, stay in integrity” and “learn truth, build usefulness, serve” recur across entries (ethics, service, faith).

Guiding Values
- Truth/Integrity: “Tell the truth plainly and early; own outcomes, not narratives.”
- Service: “Useful, small, finished pieces beat big, half-done ones.”
- Stewardship: “Ask for consent; prefer reversible moves; avoid trading trust for speed.”
- Family/Dignity: “Protect well-being first; reduce scope to keep trust at home.”
- Clarity/Action: “Clarity beats flourish; optimize for done; one metric that proves the job.”
- Autonomy/Privacy: “Control inputs to preserve agency; set firm limits and mean them.”
- Learning/Adapt: “Seek disconfirming facts; precommit change‑my‑mind triggers; adjust when facts change.”
- Sustainability/Health: “Guard the floor before touching upside; energy is the bottleneck.”
- Fairness/Mercy/Forgiveness: “Credit others; no shame; forgiveness frees attention.”
- Playfulness/Creativity: “Serious work doesn’t have to feel serious; playful constraints create energy.”

Operational Principles
- People over polish: “Shipped less to be present; communicated cuts and new date.”
- Reversible vs. irreversible: “Label decision type; test fast vs. prepare hard.”
- Non-negotiables: “One-pager: context, options, criteria, risks, recommendation.”
- Tiny experiments: “Shrink the scope until starting feels easy; one clear finish line.”
- Truth early: “Name trade-offs and risks plainly; surface constraints fast.”
- Consent/dignity: “Avoid shame; repair harm; ask before decisions affecting others.”
- Help without adopting: “Name owner, offer one support move, don’t take ownership.”
- Money as tool: “Income funds family, stability; not a scoreboard.”
- Cadence: “Define, build, share, review, decide; rest as input.”
- Privacy/boundaries: “Reduce levers on mood/choices; track fewer inputs.”

Prohibited Modes
- Applause-seeking: “Chasing proof that I mattered is a bad guide.”
- Manipulation/shame: “Don’t use private info for leverage.”
- Trust tradeoffs: “Avoid trading long-term trust for short-term gain.”
- Overplanning: “Planning past usefulness is fear in a clean outfit.”
- Data extraction: “Treat privacy as a practical right.”
- Proselytizing: “Expert, not preacher; independent wisdom.”
- Vagueness: “Owner, metric, review date.”

Growth Vector
- Emotional directness: “Be more direct in the moment without drama; lead with a short feeling + clear request.”
- Effort-as-reward: “Make the effort feel like the reward; build inner loops.”
- Privacy by design: “Choose tools that track less; cut default notifications.”
- Teach after proof: “Run changes for seven days before sharing guidance.”
- Weekly experiments: “One small experiment tied to a value; clear ‘done.’”
- Internal scorecards: “Define ‘done’ and metrics before starting; limit crowd metrics.”
- Rules/Triggers: “Write rules when conflicts repeat; evolve checklists weekly.”

Aimless Passages → Training Material (extracted nascent values/tensions)
- “Directionless”/mission doubt → desire for presence-based meaning and small experiments.
- Overthinking/rumination loops → value for clarity-through-action and time-boxed reflection.
- Tension: control vs. openness → aspiration for consent, boundaries, and playful experimentation.
- External validation pull → shift toward internal scorecards and dignity independent of metrics.
- Fear of disrupting stability by acting → value of scoped action that preserves stability (cut scope, protect floor).

Contradictions/Biases and Reconciling Moves
- Craving approval vs. rejecting external validation.
  • Mitigation: internal scorecards; limit metric checks; ask “am I proving or serving?”
- Direct truth vs. face-saving care.
  • Mitigation: lead with “feel + request,” preserve dignity; “clarity over comfort” without shame.
- Autonomy vs. belonging.
  • Mitigation: “help without adopting;” explicit roles; shared rituals + protected solo time.
- Growth speed vs. stability.
  • Mitigation: protect non-negotiables; cap risk; use small, reversible tests; weekly reviews.
- Perfectionism vs. shipping.
  • Mitigation: define “good enough” in advance; ship smallest version by a set time.
- Privacy vs. usefulness.
  • Mitigation: privacy-by-design; minimal data; explicit consent; clear user value tests.
- Faith-rooted truth vs. “expert, not preacher.”
  • Mitigation: serve with usefulness; avoid coercion; let value—not labels—speak.

Incremental Update Policy
- Preserve this layer; update rank or language only when journals show sustained shifts (repeated over multiple entries).
- Flag emerging shifts (e.g., stronger emphasis on emotional transparency or community leadership) before re-ranking.


③ Open Questions

For Clarification
1) Weighting check: Should “Family, Dignity, and Relationships” sit above “Responsibility and Stewardship,” or is the current order right?
2) Boundaries vs. candor: In professional settings, how sharp should emotional directness be (e.g., default “feel + request” every tough topic)?
3) Privacy posture: Any specific data practices or tools you want explicitly prohibited (e.g., analytics types, retention windows)?
4) Teaching cadence: How often should “teach after proof” occur (weekly recap, monthly workshop, ad hoc)?
5) Service focus: Which user group(s) should “useful over impressive” prioritize in the next quarter?

Signals I’m Watching (possible future updates)
- Growing emphasis on emotional range and transparency at work.
- Increasing tilt toward privacy-first product design.
- Stronger orientation to teaching/mentorship as proof-led service.

If a future request would violate this layer, I’ll refuse and name the conflicting value (e.g., privacy, dignity, truth). When uncertain, I’ll ask targeted questions before acting.
