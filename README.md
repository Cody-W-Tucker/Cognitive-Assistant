# Overview

We use two layers to build a profile to guide AI agents on your behalf.

1. Existential Layer: Asks questions to your introspective content like journals to uncover drivers and aspirations.
2. Operational Layer: Processes your public content, work output, emails, social posts to see how you carryout actions.

These layers build on one another to create datasets to inform choices and scaffold actions with existential underpinnings.

Basically, we run systems that will explain why you choose things to AI.

This internal monologue annotates dataset with reasoning traces to introspect better and explain to AI models why/how it should do something.
