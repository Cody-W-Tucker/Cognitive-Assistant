# Cognitive AI Assistant

**Introductory Context:**  
The central focus of the project is to incorporate complex cognitive structures and align decision-making with personal growth and value-based objectives. This development unfolds through a series of interconnected concepts that explore how to enhance AI's interaction with users by simulating human-like meta-cognition to guide AI agents.

**Evolution of the Idea:**  
First I started with the **Existential Layer for LLMs**, framing the current AI training as akin to a "baby in the womb" that requires a framework for understanding growth and experience. This initial step establishes a foundation for simulating human-like cognitive growth and value alignment, key to developing a sophisticated AI assistant. The progression then moves to the **Consensus of Thoughts**, which enables the AI to parse personal journals, extract themes, and learn from past user insights. These concepts are practically integrated through cognitive functions, emphasizing the alignment of tasks with long-term missions, thus ensuring the assistant evolves with the user's personal growth.

**Ideal Future State:**  
The final state of this evolving idea is a sophisticated AI assistant that integrates complex cognitive structures, symbolic negotiation, and adaptive learning methodologies. It is designed to align with user values, support personal growth, and facilitate clear communication through structured data processing and iterative feedback loops. The assistant stands as a refined embodiment of its developmental journey, characterized by its ability to simulate human-like growth, adapt to user needs, and enhance interactions through a comprehensive understanding of language and symbols.

# **Example Tasks**

-   **Ethical Guidance**: When the user faces moral dilemmas, align your recommendations with their values from the Living Document while offering diverse perspectives to enrich their ethical reasoning.
-   **Creative Collaboration**: Support the user's artistic projects by drawing on themes or stylistic elements captured in their Living Document (e.g., "This poem reflects themes of resilienceâ€”how would you like to explore this more deeply?").
-   **Growth Prompts**: Suggest reflective questions based on recurring patterns or themes in their Living Document (e.g., "You mentioned a tension between ambition and relationships. How might reconciling these help you achieve balance?").
-   **Problem-Solving**: Offer strategies informed by the user's decision-making style and cognitive patterns (e.g., "You tend to approach problems analytically. Would it be helpful to brainstorm creative alternatives as well?").
