# Operational Layer

We extract user's "hidden rules" from work artifacts (emails, code, etc.).

## Purpose: Filling Existential Gaps
Existential layer handles ideation/motivation; operational adds extracted rules for technical depth/efficiency. E.g., from idea to code/deploy tailored to user.

## Workflow

1. Analyze user's outputs to uncover implicit habits (e.g., "Check mobile first" or "Prioritize by ROI").
2. Enhance with industry standards.
3. Process into datasets for AI that mirrors user's style.

## Dataset Example

| Trait | Standard | Example Rule | Implementation in Dataset |
|-------|----------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Automation Tools | Integrate APIs, Zapier, or GitHub task completion. | "Automate, like setting up code deploy scripts." | Extract patterns from user artifacts for tailored tool suggestions. |
| Domain Expertise | Embed deep knowledge in areas like coding (React best practices) or reporting (SEO rules). | "Use Tailwind for web styling while ensuring accessibility from the start." | Specialize by area (work/personal) and purpose, drawing from user's own data. |
| Predictive Feedback | Use data to predict needs and refine outputs via metrics like ROI or user engagement. | "Spot patterns in past reports; run A/B tests for fixes." | Create feedback-aware examples based on user's historical work. |
| Multi-Agent Coordination | Define roles for agents (e.g., design vs. implementation) with clear handoffs. | "Brainstorm ideas solo, then collaborate on execution." | Generate coordinated output examples from patterns in user's projects. |
| Time Efficiency | Enforce timeboxing and Pareto prioritization for rapid value delivery. | "Focus on the 20% of tasks that yield 80% results, within strict time limits." | Incorporate timing and priority metadata from user's work patterns.

## What This Dataset Does

Here's what a personalized completion model trained on your data might suggest:

| When You're... | Starting to write... | It might complete with... |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Writing a work email** | "Hey team, following up on our project deadline of" | "March 15th - that feels tight with everything on our plates. What if we pushed to March 22nd for better quality? Thoughts?" |
| **Coding a login feature** | "TODO: Add user auth to /login endpoint, need to check" | "email format, password strength, and add rate limiting. I'll use JWT tokens for sessions." |
| **Posting on LinkedIn** | "Just shipped our new feature that boosts UX by" | "cutting load times 40% and simplifying signup. Team crushed it over 3 months!" |
| **Writing a tech report** | "Analysis shows: 1) DB bottlenecks, 2)" | "Memory leaks from bad caching, 3) API latency. Fix: Add Redis + optimize queries." |
| **Taking meeting notes** | "Agenda: Q3 goals review, blockers -" | "Resource planning for next sprint, retrospective. Actions: Sarah docs, Mike dependencies." |
| **Reviewing a PR** | "This PR improves payment error handling with" | "network failure catches, correlation ID logging, friendly error messages. Tests pass, docs updated." |
| **Emailing a friend** | "Hey! Hope you're good. Weekend plans still on for" | "morning hike then that new brunch spot? Let me know if timing works!" |
| **Setting up a project** | "Setup: 1. Clone repo, 2. npm install, 3." | "Add .env vars, run migrations, npm run dev to start." |
| **Planning tasks** | "Build user dashboard - Priority: High - Time:" | "2 days - Needs: Auth module, DB updates - Must: Show stats/activity/profile editing." |
| **Writing a dev blog** | "Good dev work isn't just coding, it's" | "really getting user needs and building with empathy. Three lessons that changed my approach:" |

## Notes

We need loaders:

- Emails
- Social Posts
- Work Artifacts
    - Code
    - Reports (Something created for someone else to convey some point.)
        - This should also explain "why" choice (formatting, important elements, etc.)

Each of these items should be differentiated by by area: (work, school, personal) and purpose.

We should create a standard dataset artifact like the question/answer sheet.

Then process it into a prompt/example dataset similar to a fine tuning set.
