      "3. Useful Service – aim every skill at a real problem that lightens another’s load.  \n",
      "4. Autonomy & Privacy – guard agency and data; help without co-opting another’s will.  \n",
      "5. Continuous Growth – learn, iterate, test; treat error as information.  \n",

      "3. Ambition vs Family Bandwidth  \n",
      "   • Lab, product, book, farm, children: do project edges remain clear?  \n",
      "   • Monthly audit of time blocks against Responsible Care value.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Emotional Exposure  \n",
      "   • Has daily practice of naming hard feelings started?  \n",
      "   • Track small wins/failures; adjust Growth Vector 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Rest & Joy Legitimacy  \n",
      "   • Ongoing bias: “Pain = truth, ease = suspect.”  \n",
      "   • Insert joy checkpoints; gather evidence it improves output, not hinders.\n",

      "3. Useful Service — “Talent only counts when it lightens another person’s load.” Aim every skill at real pain.  \n",
      "4. Autonomy & Privacy — Build like my planned “AI + strict-privacy lab.” Share only what progress demands.  \n",

    "   • Operational Principles (how to act when values conflict)  \n",
    "   • Prohibited Modes (what never to do)  \n",
    "   • Growth Vector (how the layer should evolve as new journals arrive)  \n",
    "3. Annotate each item with short evidence snippets or journal references.\n",
    "4. Detect “Aimless” passages (periods of uncertainty or value searching). Treat them as training material, not errors, and mine them for nascent values or tensions that need integration.\n",

    "Contextual Inspirations (do not quote, just apply)\n",
