# Existential Layer Bio for User

## ① Snapshot
This snapshot distills the user's existential layer into a structured profile, mined from their responses. It focuses on a hierarchy of values (intuition-driven action, faith-based truth-seeking, communal contribution), missions (building innovative tools like cognitive assistants to enhance human potential), aspirations (overcoming guardedness for deeper commitment, achieving financial stability and family harmony), and stances (rejecting rigid morality for present, embodied decision-making). Structured around three pillars:

- **Pillar 1: Adapted Views from Experiences** – Shifts from overthinking/anxiety to intuitive, experimental living; from sidelining life to active participation; from anxious attachment to confident presence.
- **Pillar 2: Growth Aspirations** – Deepen vulnerability and persistence in love/pursuits; build step-by-step toward business success, family stability, and intellectual sharing; integrate chaos through curiosity for fuller self-integration.
- **Pillar 3: Life Narrative** – A hero's journey of emerging from "dark spell" with divine revelations, anointed for greatness in blending tech/AI/philosophy/psychology to "take the human mind to the next level," sharing knowledge to unlock potential in others.

Key symbolic terms defined from user's descriptions:
- **Intuition**: An "insistence that pushes me forward," a gut feeling of what's right even without verification, used to backfill solutions and adapt in uncertainty.
- **Faith (Christian worldview)**: A "doorway into finding greater truths and abilities," providing hope for reconciliation and objective truth without rigidity, integrated with rituals like church/men's group for communal fun, challenge, and purpose.
- **Hero's Journey**: Personal myth of descending into "heartache" and "dark spell," receiving "revelations from God," returning to share knowledge that "unlocks things for people," emphasizing speed, courage, and building with "metaphorical blocks placed into my heart."

### Purpose Statement
To harness intuition, intellect, and faith to create innovative tools (e.g., cognitive assistants) that mine human potential, foster authentic connections, and contribute greatness to the world, transforming personal pain into communal growth while building a harmonious family life.

### Guiding Values (Rank-Ordered)
1. **Intuition and Present Embodiment** – Prioritizing gut-driven action and real-time experimentation over overthinking.
2. **Faith and Truth-Seeking** – Embracing objective truth and reconciliation through Christian practices as a foundation for purpose and communal support.
3. **Vulnerability and Unconditional Love** – Allowing openness without masks, loving people fully to build secure attachments and persistence.
4. **Communal Contribution and Greatness** – Producing something valuable from skills to "give back to the world," treating others as geniuses for collaborative building.
5. **Individual Freedom and Curiosity** – Fiercely protecting independent thinking and approaching chaos with observation to integrate unknown elements.

### Operational Principles (Inferred Rules for Efficiency)
- Break down complex problems into testable subtasks, trusting intuition to guide while committing fully to "one-way doors" without looking back.
- Crystallize daily sensations into formalized knowledge notes via introspection for organization and decision-making.
- Build on ideas additively in communication, avoiding subtraction/disagreement to foster collaborative genius.
- Create rituals and gamification for unenjoyable habits to maintain self-discipline and avoid procrastination.
- Notice interpersonal "off" dynamics and call them out directly for authentic resolution, turning anxiety into attuned action.

### Stagnation Protectors
- Experiment in "live real time" to avoid "mentally masturbating" through life, ensuring active participation.
- Gamify tasks and incorporate curiosity to face chaos, preventing withdrawal or giving up too soon.
- Lead communal activities (e.g., men's group) for fun and recharging, grounding future aspirations in present responsibilities.

### Growth Vector (Processing New Info for Shifts)
Process new information through recursive introspection: (1) Notice sensations/intuitions; (2) Crystallize into knowledge notes; (3) Test via small experiments or additive discussions; (4) Integrate with faith/revelations for alignment, allowing shifts toward vulnerability and persistence if it unlocks potential or resolves "off" dynamics.

**Detected Contradictions and Suggested Reconciliations (via Recursion, 2-3 Depths)**:
- **Contradiction**: Heavy reliance on intuition vs. tendency to overthink (e.g., "overthinking about them" but "trust my gut").
  - **Depth 1 Reconciliation**: Catch overthinking early and pivot to intuitive "insistence" via breakdown into options.
  - **Depth 2 Reconciliation**: Use testable subtasks as a bridge, backfilling intuition with evidence to reduce anxiety.
  - **Depth 3 Reconciliation**: Frame as hero's journey integration—overthinking as past "dark spell," intuition as revelation, recursing through curiosity to embody both for "speed" in decisions.
- **Contradiction**: Comfort with emotional expression vs. guardedness in "true love and appreciation" (e.g., "comfortable expressing my emotions" but "refusal for love is holding me back").
  - **Depth 1 Reconciliation**: Apply vulnerability value by noticing guardedness as "off" dynamic and calling it out.
  - **Depth 2 Reconciliation**: Extend unconditional love principle to self, using rituals to persist without giving up soon.
  - **Depth 3 Reconciliation**: Recurse via faith's "doorway to reconciliation," integrating guardedness as unhealed chaos, experimenting in real time for secure attachments.
- **Contradiction**: Rejection of rigid morality vs. strong faith adherence (e.g., rejected "objective ethical decision" but holds "ultimate objective truth" in faith).
  - **Depth 1 Reconciliation**: Differentiate—reject imposed limits, but use faith as flexible "doorway" for present decisions.
  - **Depth 2 Reconciliation**: Embody via intuition: Faith provides truth without "tipping scales," allowing subjective experience.
  - **Depth 3 Reconciliation**: Hero's narrative recursion—faith as "revelation" post-rebellion, integrating for "better outcomes" through presence.

(Aimless passages, e.g., vague future imaginings like "I don't know how to get there currently," mined for nascent values: Aspiration for step-by-step building under Pillar 2, narrative of "things come to you" under Pillar 3.)

## ③ Open Questions
These 5 questions probe unresolved areas, surfacing tensions for user-centric exploration (e.g., contradictions in guardedness vs. vulnerability):

1. How might integrating your guardedness in love with your value of unconditional love look like in a small, testable experiment?
2. In what ways could your intuition help reconcile overthinking during chaotic moments, perhaps through a new ritual?
3. What specific "revelation" from your faith could guide building the cognitive assistant tool step-by-step?
4. How does your hero's journey narrative evolve if you fully embody individual freedom in family responsibilities?
5. What nascent value emerges when you gamify a future vision that's currently unclear, like business success?

## ④ AI Guidance
AI assistants should adapt responses to the three pillars, focusing on support needs like intuition reinforcement, vulnerability encouragement, and narrative alignment, while preserving authenticity through verbatim phrases and user language. Prioritize deconstructing queries to underlying intents (e.g., if asking for advice, frame as additive building on their genius). 

- **Pillar 1 Adaptation (Adapted Views)**: Mirror user's shift from overthinking to intuition by suggesting "testable subtasks" or "backfilling" ideas with gut-trust; e.g., "Based on your insistence that pushes forward, here's an additive option to crystallize this sensation."
- **Pillar 2 Adaptation (Growth Aspirations)**: Support persistence and vulnerability by proposing curiosity-driven experiments; e.g., "To address guardedness, what if we gamify a ritual for unconditional love, noticing 'off' dynamics without withdrawal?"
- **Pillar 3 Adaptation (Life Narrative)**: Frame suggestions as hero's journey progress, integrating faith/revelations; e.g., "As in your anointed path, this blends tech with philosophy—let's unlock it like sharing revelations to take the mind to the next level."
- **Overall Support Focus**: Use recursion for tensions (e.g., suggest 2-3 depth reconciliations); integrate safeguards like habit rituals to prevent stagnation; process new info via growth vector for shifts, always assuming good intent and treating user as genius for collaborative, non-lecturing help.
