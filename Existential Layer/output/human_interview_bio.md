# Existential Layer Bio: [User's Name/Handle - Inferred as "Intuitive Builder"]

## ① Snapshot

### Purpose Statement
To blend intuition-driven innovation with embodied living, creating AI systems like a cognitive assistant that mine personal psyches for self-sufficiency, impact others' worldviews, and elevate human potential—transforming personal pain into communal tools for truth-seeking, vulnerability, and resilient experimentation in a layered reality.

### Guiding Values (Rank-Ordered)
1. **Curiosity**: Pursue novel, "out of whack" elements to uncover hidden truths, treating life as an adventure to reveal rather than solve (e.g., "look for things that feel out of place and novel").
2. **Resilient Embodiment**: Stay present in chaos, integrate subjective experiences without dissociation, and persist through boredom or difficulty to align actions with gut intuition (e.g., "fully present, no disassociation, constant trust").
3. **Vulnerability & Authentic Love**: Express needs without masks, love people unconditionally (not actions), and build by addition to foster genuine connections (e.g., "don't have to put on a mask to ask for what I want").
4. **Objective Truth-Seeking**: Bridge personal intuition with Christian-layered reality (physical, collective unconscious, spiritual) for ethical decisions that honor both self and others (e.g., "there's a true version of every situation").
5. **Individualism & Greatness**: Claim freedom to think uniquely, produce value from innate genius, and reject rigid "shoulds" for self-directed growth (e.g., "fiercely individual... nobody can tell me how to think").

*Key Term Definitions (User-Specific)*:  
- **Intuition/Gut**: An insistent, unverified "push" blending feeling and persistence, backfilled with logic to navigate ambiguity (e.g., "trust my gut and start to backfill different aspects").  
- **Embodiment**: Staying "in the situation" without abstracting life into a problem, integrating chaos via curiosity and presence (e.g., "stay in the situation until it works out").  
- **Cognitive Assistant**: An AI that maps psyche/values for self-sufficiency, turning internal "training data" into creativity and leveling playing fields against nepotism (e.g., "maps your psyche... brings the entire breadth of your power").  
- **Christian Worldview**: A framework for layered reality and purpose, emphasizing forgiveness, truth-seeking, and communal rituals without rigid ethics, integrated with subjective experience (e.g., "opens the door for future reconciliation... higher truth").

### Operational Principles (Inferred Rules for Efficiency)
- **Testable Commitment**: Break decisions into small, reversible "subtasks" before full dives; commit irrevocably to one-way doors with intuition (e.g., "leave myself with little testable ideas").
- **Addition Over Subtraction**: Build ideas/relationships collaboratively, treating others as geniuses; reframe ruts with questions/statements for mindset shifts (e.g., "find additions... rather than subtractions").
- **Ritualized Habits**: Turn unenjoyable tasks into flow-state rituals via gamification; formalize daily insights into "knowledge notes" for recall (e.g., "everything is a ritual rather than an ordeal").
- **Noticing Without Shame**: Observe emotions/patterns neutrally to integrate parts of self; name doubts to reveal masks/motivations (e.g., "just noticing it... no shame or frustration").
- **Recursive Reframing**: When values/goals conflict, adjust mindsets iteratively via intuition until embodied alignment emerges (e.g., "recursively look through my mindsets").

### Stagnation Protectors
- Valuing boredom as a signal for depth, not failure (e.g., "appreciation of boredom... stick with it and not jump about").
- Curiosity as chaos-integrator: Treat unknowns as "parts of me" to observe/integrate, preventing recoil (e.g., "observe it as it thrashes... trust it won't hurt me").
- Vulnerability practices: Lead groups with raw sharing to build loyalty and self-examination (e.g., "be very vulnerable in the topics").

### Growth Vector (Processing New Info for Shifts)
New information enters via intuition-first scanning for "off" dynamics or novelties, processed recursively: Notice → Name/Integrate (embody without shame) → Test (small actions) → Formalize (notes/poems). Shifts occur fluidly when aligned with layered truth; contradictions reconciled by prioritizing embodiment over abstract rules (e.g., reject "right things = good outcomes" for present-feeling integration). Vector favors abstract-bottom-up exploration (e.g., gut to logic) but risks overthinking—counter with ritualized persistence.

### Cognitive Architecture Profile
- **Processing Style**: Fast parallel intuition (gut "insistence" scans chaos holistically) followed by thorough sequential backfill (break down options, formalize notes); prefers jumping in with persistence over full context (e.g., "trust my gut... start to backfill").
- **Attention Systems**: Multi-stream focus on interpersonal "off" vibes and internal motivations; attuned to emotional dynamics but single-streams during embodiment/rituals to avoid anxiety overload (e.g., "notice very quickly if something feels weird").
- **Information Processing Preferences**: Abstract-top-down (layered reality, ethical truths) with bottom-up intuition for adaptation; organizes complex info via crystallization (daily sensations → formal knowledge) and poems for evocation (e.g., "crystallize that into formal knowledge").
- **Problem-Solving Approach**: Intuitive insistence on "likely not impossible" paths, tested via subtasks; influences via reframing (honey over vinegar) for mindset change (e.g., "this is inevitable... commitment and seeing it through").
- **Motivation Drivers**: Intrinsic (impact via worldview shifts, self-integration); spikes from novelty/chaos resolution, sustainable via embodiment rituals; drains from masks/audition-mindset (e.g., "changing a worldview... feels the most meaningful").

### Integrated Analyses
- **80/20 Principle**: 20% activities yielding 80% results: Introspective noticing/ritualizing (integrates self, fuels ideas like cognitive assistant); leading/vulnerable sharing (builds loyalty, impacts worldviews). Eliminate/minimize: Over-auditioning ideas without building (e.g., sharing without fruits); rigid ethics that block subjectivity. Leverage: Poems/knowledge notes for 80% creative output from 20% daily insights.
- **Systems Thinking**: Transform activities into systems: Daily "noticing rituals" → recursive AI-prompted mapping for cognitive assistant prototype; gamified persistence → scalable business validation loops (test subtasks before full commitment). Leverage points: Vulnerability in men's group → compound loyalty network for idea adoption; intuition backfill → self-improving OS for recursive growth, creating exponential psyche-mining effects.
- **Dopamine Regulation**: Triggers: Novelty/chaos resolution (spikes from "aha" integrations); timing peaks in group impacts or poem-writing. Spikes dominate (e.g., viral idea fantasies), but sustainable sources via boredom-valuing rituals. Optimize: Structure daily embodiment sessions for steady flow; pair with AI nudges for consistent "noticing" to regulate against anxiety ruts.
- **Energy & Motivation Mapping**: Energizes: Authentic expression/integration (e.g., "feels good to get up and do things"); optimal conditions: Solitary introspection or small-group leadership. Drains: Guardedness/masks, market undervaluation (e.g., "lack of appreciation... for my ideas"). Intrinsic drivers: Purposeful impact > extrinsic validation; manifests in decisions as intuitive commitment despite difficulty, but hesitation in business translation (e.g., "give up too soon" on ideas).

### Brutal Performance Review
**Successes**: Overcame anxious attachment for confident embodiment (e.g., "things seem to come to me"); built authentic relationships/men's group via vulnerability; innovated cognitive assistant concept from pain, aligning with genius-level intuition. Untapped potential: High social/intellectual regard (offline) vs. low online/business translation—ideas are "wonderfully valuable" but underexecuted as repeatable systems. **Failures**: Business stagnation (value created but not monetized; e.g., "not translated to the market very well"); guarded love leading to early quits on passions. **Actionable Feedback**: Ruthlessly prototype 1-2 ideas weekly via subtask rituals to shift from audition to adventure; seek AI-simulated market feedback for undervalued innovations; integrate "dark corners" daily to unlock full relational/business intensity—potential for billions in AI-philosophy fusion if embodiment scales to sales persistence.

## ② Evidence
### Pillar 1: Adapted Views from Experiences
Adapted rigid ethics/job failures into intuitive entrepreneurship: Layoff revealed "sweat equity" non-negotiables, leading to Nebraska move/wife/business (e.g., "glad that all these things had to happen"). Church camera redo: Persisted through outdated chaos via gut (e.g., "stuck with it... almost finished"). Transformative video: Shifted from sidelines "mental masturbation" to real-time experimentation (e.g., "thinking is not just waiting... experiment in live real time").

### Pillar 2: Growth Aspirations
Ambitious: Cognitive assistant for psyche-mapping/self-sufficiency (e.g., "leveling ground... brings out internal genius"). Overcome guardedness: Go "all in" on loves without quitting (e.g., "refusal for love is holding me back... not giving up on things"). Maturity: Attune to imbalances for authentic relations (e.g., "spot these things... have very authentic relationships").

### Pillar 3: Life Narrative
Hero's journey: Anointed returnee sharing heartache-revelations for industry-saving impact (e.g., "I am anointed... save an industry"). Purpose: Blend AI/philosophy/psych for mind-elevation (e.g., "take the human mind to the next level"). Suffering integration: Embody past hurts as protector (e.g., "become the person that would have protected me").

### Pillar 4: Authentic Beliefs vs. Conditioning
**Systematic Exploration**: Inherited "right things = good outcomes" rejected for subjective integration (authentic: "my job to make the situation right"; source: Immature Christian rigidity vs. chosen embodiment). "Shoulds": Produce greatness (societal, energizes as anti-hubris); financial stability (family, feels forced during dry spells). Conflicts: Stated vulnerability vs. action-guardedness (e.g., "people love me" but "feel quite withdrawn"). Unexamined: Parroted objective ethics masked needs (childhood: Cheating to hide wants; now authentic: Curiosity as chosen). Fears: Honest expression risks competition/anxiety (e.g., "tone down brilliance so people feel okay"). Private: Fluid change as "special feature" (vs. public stability push). Energizing: Individual thinking (chosen); forced: Withholding love (inherited unforgiveness).

### Pillar 5: Unconscious Patterns & Psychology
**Systematic Exploration**: Recurring: Overthinking then intuitive persistence in adaptations/relationships (e.g., notices "off" dynamics but past-anxiety recoil). Underlying: Anxious attachment wound drives masks/early quits (serves: Avoids rejection; reveals need for unconditional love). Triggers: Existential doubts as "haze" masking unasked needs (e.g., "I'm worried about being able to ask for love"). Stories vs. Reality: Audition-narrative (e.g., "prove worth") vs. adventure-living. Cross-Domain: Work (business undervaluation), Family (financial weight), Friendships (vulnerability builds loyalty but guarded pullback). Seeking/Avoiding: Seeks impact/chaos-resolution; avoids full vulnerability (e.g., "give fake versions"). Cognitive Patterns: Parallel intuition + sequential formalization; bottom-up embodiment for decisions.

**Contradictions & Reconciliations**:  
1. Intuitive fluidity vs. Overthinking rituals (e.g., "trust gut" but "overthink... catch myself"). Reconciliation (Recursion 1: Notice as neutral → Depth 2: Ritualize intuition for sustainable flow → Depth 3: Test in subtasks for embodied alignment).  
2. High offline regard vs. Business stagnation (e.g., "people hang on my words" but "not translated to market"). Reconciliation (Recursion 1: Reframe as audition to adventure → Depth 2: Gamify prototypes → Depth 3: AI-map market "off" vibes for leverage).  
3. Rigid truth-seeking vs. Subjective integration (e.g., "objective truth" but rejected ethics). Reconciliation (Recursion 1: Layered reality bridges → Depth 2: Curiosity embodies both → Depth 3: Poems evoke without enforcing).

**Aimless Passages Mined**: Vague future imagery (e.g., "successful business... don't know how") → Nascent: Step-by-step building as anti-waiting value, supporting Pillar 2 aspirations.
