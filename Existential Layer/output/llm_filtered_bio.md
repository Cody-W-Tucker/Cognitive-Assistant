① Snapshot of Layer (with Pillars)
-----------------------------------

### Pillar 1: Current Adapted Views (Shaped by Experiences and Reconciled Tensions)
Views refined through practical trials, emphasizing feedback over verdicts, direct communication, and sustainability. Reconciled tensions include shifting from control/isolation to contribution/connection, and from perfectionism to iterative shipping.

### Pillar 2: Growth Aspirations (Uncovering Implicit Goals and Evolutions)
Aspirations focus on embodied mastery, curiosity-driven building (e.g., AI tools), and sustainable rhythms. Implicit goals evolve toward intrinsic rewards, emotional directness, and bias-calibrated decisions, uncovering evolutions like treating discipline as "gentle scaffolding."

### Pillar 3: Life Narrative (Framing Personal Myths, Journeys, and Communication Preferences)
Narratives frame a myth of resilient iteration—small wins over breakthroughs, journeys from failure to feedback, with preferences for concise, direct communication (e.g., "leading with the point") and reflective logs. Myths include the "ordinary Tuesday" pivot as a symbol of spontaneous widening of life.

### Existential Layer
#### Purpose Statement
To exist through building useful tools and connections that turn effort into intrinsic rewards, grounded in iterative learning (Pillar 1: reconciled failure as feedback), aspiring to sustainable mastery (Pillar 2: curiosity over posturing), narrated as a journey of small, embodied wins (Pillar 3: myths of consistent follow-through).

#### Guiding Values (Rank-Ordered, with Pillar Cross-References)
1. **Contribution over Control** (Pillar 1: Reconciled isolation to connection; Pillar 2: Aspires to tools helping others; Pillar 3: Narratives of men's group and teaching peers).
2. **Sustainability over Sprints** (Pillar 1: Adapted from stress protection; Pillar 2: Evolves routines like daily blocks; Pillar 3: Journeys frame gentle scaffolding myths).
3. **Curiosity over Posturing** (Pillar 1: Feedback-seeking; Pillar 2: Implicit goal of bias calibration; Pillar 3: Communication prefers verifiable claims).
4. **Connection over Isolation** (Pillar 1: Reconciled through group commitments; Pillar 2: Aspirations for intrinsic rewards in work; Pillar 3: Myths of shared feedback and small promises).

#### Operational Principles (Inferred Hidden Rules from Actions)
- **Tighten Loops via Small Tests**: Implicitly prioritize shortest paths to feedback, inferred from shipping rough versions without polish to decide quickly (e.g., one-hour timer for projects).
- **Anchor in Concrete Metrics**: Generalize vague ideas by picking units/math, revealed in back-of-envelope planning and tracking one core metric unconsciously to avoid overwhelm.
- **Protect Energy with Boundaries**: Unconsciously shift work to strengths, default to "not now" for commitments, inferred from pruning low-value tasks and time-boxing.
- **Reframe Heat as Data**: In messy situations, label emotions/behaviors as signals, guiding choices by interpreting without drama (e.g., quick self-scans before calls).

#### Stagnation Protectors
- **Time-Boxed Bets**: Limit exploration with timers, running parallel small experiments and killing weak ones fast to break rumination cycles.
- **Embodied Resets**: Use physical cues (e.g., walks, tidying) as triggers to restart after slips, preventing recursive self-blame.
- **Weekly Reviews with Curiosity**: Log patterns without blame, focusing on what mattered to reframe stagnation as data for adjustment.

#### Growth Vector
Process new info by logging forecasts/tests, scoring them for calibration, then embodying shifts through small commitments (e.g., daily deliverables). Emphasizes realizations like "results are feedback on choices," reshaping values via reflection (Pillar 1) and embodiment (Pillar 2), converging on narrative myths of trust-building (Pillar 3).

② Supporting Evidence (Quotes/Tensions)
----------------------------------------

### Evidence Snippets
- **Purpose Statement**: "Building an AI assistant that could help real people—limiting scope, delivering small pieces, and asking for feedback" (<20 words; ties to building for contribution).
- **Guiding Values (Contribution over Control)**: "Valuing connection over isolation, contribution over control" (<10 words; direct from values derivation).
- **Operational Principles (Tighten Loops via Small Tests)**: "Setting a one-hour timer, building the roughest version of one, and making the call the same day" (<15 words; inferred from decision-by-doing).
- **Stagnation Protectors (Time-Boxed Bets)**: "Time-boxing exploration, deciding, and moving; running two small bets in parallel and killing the weaker one fast" (<15 words; anti-rumination tactic).
- **Growth Vector**: "Tracking forecasts with a simple log, then scoring them" (<10 words; calibration via reflection).

### Tensions/Contradictions and Reconciliations
- **Tension: Control vs. Flexibility** (Pillar 1: Prized "control, clear wins" but adapted to "curiosity over posturing"; bias toward detail-first anchoring skews against big-picture jumps).
  - Level 1: Explore alternatives—rigid control leads to isolation; flexibility risks chaos.
  - Level 2: Test via small bets (e.g., train to "scan for links across ideas") to blend both.
  - Synthesis: Reconcile as "gentle scaffolding" (Pillar 2), embodying control in sustainable rhythms (Pillar 3 narrative of ordinary pivots).
- **Tension: Emotional Understatement vs. Directness** (Pillar 3: Prefers "understating" in professional settings but aspires to "more direct in the moment"; potential bias of replaying conversations recursively).
  - Level 1: Alternatives—suppression builds resentment; over-sharing risks vulnerability.
  - Level 2: Modular practice: "quick self-scan before key calls" to calibrate.
  - Synthesis: Evolve to "naming the feeling, linking it to a concrete trigger" (Pillar 2), framing as myth of "getting proof" through honest exchanges (Pillar 1 adapted views).
- **Aimless Passage Mining**: Cut-off on creative "dry spells" (Pillar 3: Narrative of "going through dry spells and, when ideas"—nascent value in playful persistence; reconcile tension of imperfection via Pillar 2 aspiration for "letting voice be imperfect," synthesizing as "Wait, that's it... creativity as messy fragments" for growth vector).

③ Open Questions (3-7 Lightweight Prompts)
------------------------------------------

1. What specific AI tool outcome would feel like a "clear win" in your building journey?
2. How has a recent "ordinary Tuesday" pivot reshaped your view of spontaneity?
3. When does "curiosity over posturing" feel most challenged in group settings?
4. What new small test could calibrate a belief you're holding loosely?
5. How might you expand emotional directness in one low-stakes relationship?
6. What's a dry spell in creativity teaching you about sustainability?
7. If you revisited a past failure, what fresh feedback emerges now?

④ AI Guidance (How Agents Should Adapt Responses to Pillars)
------------------------------------------------------------

- **Pillar 1 Adaptation**: Frame responses as feedback on choices, not verdicts; use direct, verifiable claims to align with adapted views, e.g., back suggestions with concrete metrics.
- **Pillar 2 Adaptation**: Encourage growth via small, embodied tests (e.g., "Try a 5-minute version"); highlight intrinsic rewards to uncover aspirations, avoiding sprints in favor of sustainable evolutions.
- **Pillar 3 Adaptation**: Structure replies concisely (lead with point, short lines); weave in narrative elements like "small wins" myths to match communication preferences, fostering journeys through reflective logs. Overall, adapt by tightening loops—suggest time-boxed actions, protect against stagnation with curiosity-driven resets, and reconcile tensions modularly without over-fitting to one perspective.
