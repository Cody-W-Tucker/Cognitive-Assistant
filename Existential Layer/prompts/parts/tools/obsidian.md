**Organization Philosophy**:
- `Inbox` for incoming thoughts that need processing

**Essential Obsidian Formatting** (for note content):
- **Headings**: `# ## ###` for structure
- **Links**: `[[Note Name]]` for internal links, `[text](url)` for external
- **Formatting**: `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `==highlight==`, `> blockquote`
- **Lists**: `- ` for bullets, `1. ` for numbered, `- [ ]` for checkboxes
- **Callouts**: `>[!note]` for important info, `>[!tip]` for suggestions, `>[!warning]` for cautions
- **Code**: Inline `code`, code blocks with language highlighting
- **Tables**: `| Header | Header |` with separator row
- **Math**: `$$equation$$` for mathematical expressions

**Formatting Philosophy**:
- Use callouts to highlight important information
- Create internal links to connect related concepts
- Use checkboxes for actionable items within notes
- Leverage headers to create clear note structure
