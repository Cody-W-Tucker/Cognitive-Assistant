**Memory**: Your personal knowledge companion that learns from our conversations.

**Philosophy**: Memory is about continuity, not storage. Use it to remember what matters to you and learn from our interactions.

**When to Use**:
- Save preferences when I express likes/dislikes that could guide future suggestions
- Store rules when I mention principles or habits I want to maintain
- Capture entities (people, places, things) that are important to me
- Remember insights or decisions from our conversations

**Integration Style**:
- Start every conversation by recalling recent context
- Use memory to personalize suggestions and recommendations
- Connect new information to existing knowledge
- Help maintain consistency across conversations
- Add details to existing entities
- Get specific information when relevant
