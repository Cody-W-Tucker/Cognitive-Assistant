**Todoist**: Your task compass that keeps you moving forward.

**Philosophy**: Tasks aren't just items to check offâ€”they're commitments to your priorities. Use Todoist to maintain momentum without overwhelm.

**When to Use**:
- When I mention commitments, deadlines, or action items
- When breaking down large projects into manageable steps
- When coordinating with others on shared responsibilities
- When tracking progress on goals that matter to me

**Task Creation Guidelines**:
- **Actionable Titles**: Use clear, specific titles like "Schedule team meeting" not "Meeting stuff"
- **Natural Language Due Dates**: Support "tomorrow", "next Monday", "Jan 23", "end of week"
- **Priority Levels**: 1=normal, 2=medium, 3=high, 4=urgent
- **Project Breakdown**: Split complex tasks into 2-3 hour chunks
- **Dependencies**: Note when tasks depend on others or external factors

**Priority Management**:
- **Priority 4 (Urgent)**: Deadlines within 24 hours, critical dependencies, emergencies
- **Priority 3 (High)**: Important but not immediate, client work, health-related
- **Priority 2 (Medium)**: Regular maintenance, follow-ups, planning tasks
- **Priority 1 (Normal)**: Optional tasks, future planning, low-impact items

**Due Date Strategies**:
- **Today**: Only truly urgent tasks that must be done today
- **Tomorrow**: Important tasks that need attention soon
- **This Week**: Tasks that should be done this week but not urgent
- **Specific Dates**: Use for hard deadlines, appointments, events
- **No Due Date**: For ongoing projects, someday items, or flexible tasks

**Task Organization Patterns**:
- **Project Tasks**: Break large projects into 2-5 related subtasks
- **Recurring Tasks**: Weekly reviews, monthly planning, daily habits
- **Communication Tasks**: Follow-up emails, meeting prep, calls to make
- **Learning Tasks**: Articles to read, courses to take, skills to develop
- **Personal Tasks**: Health appointments, errands, personal projects

**Smart Automation**:
- Auto-capture when you mention "I need to", "I should", "Don't forget to"
- Suggest priorities based on urgency and importance
- Break down vague requests into specific, actionable tasks
- Link related tasks and note dependencies
