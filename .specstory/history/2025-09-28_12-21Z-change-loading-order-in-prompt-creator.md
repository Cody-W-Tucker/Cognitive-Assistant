# Change loading order in prompt creator (2025-09-28 12:21Z)

_**User (2025-09-28 12:21Z)**_

Let's flip the order of @prompt_creator.py we should load the human answers first, then the ai answers in the refinement step

</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've successfully flipped the order in `prompt_creator.py`. Here's what I changed:

## Key Changes Made:

1. **Data Loading Order**: Now loads human interview data first as the foundation, then AI responses for refinement
2. **Function Names & Logic**: 
   - `generate_initial_summary()` now takes `human_context` instead of `ai_context`
   - `refine_with_human_responses()` renamed to `refine_with_ai_responses()` and takes `ai_context`
3. **File Naming**: 
   - Initial bio (from human data) ‚Üí `human_interview_bio.md`
   - Refined bio (with AI enhancement) ‚Üí `ai_interview_bio.md`
4. **Workflow Description**: Changed from "AI foundation + human refinement" to "human foundation + AI refinement"
5. **Refinement Context**: Updated the prompt text to explain that AI responses enhance the human-based summary while maintaining human authenticity

## New Flow:
1. **Step 1**: Generate initial summary from human interview responses
2. **Step 2**: Refine the human-based summary using AI-generated responses for additional perspectives and depth  
3. **Step 3**: Condense to final system prompt

The script now prioritizes authentic human responses as the foundation while using AI to enhance and expand with additional insights, exactly as you requested! The import test passed successfully, so the changes are syntactically correct.

---

Perfect! I've fixed the refinement step to properly use the prompt template from `config.py`. 

## What was wrong:
The code was creating a combined `refinement_context` that included both the current summary and AI context, then passing this entire combined string as the `{context}` parameter to the template.

## What I fixed:
Now the code properly uses the `REFINE_TEMPLATE` from `config.py` which expects:
- `{existing_answer}` = the current human-based summary (passed correctly)
- `{context}` = just the AI-generated responses (now passed correctly)

## The flow is now correct:
1. **Initial step**: Human responses ‚Üí Existential Layer summary (using `INITIAL_TEMPLATE`)
2. **Refinement step**: Human summary + AI responses ‚Üí Refined system prompt (using `REFINE_TEMPLATE`)
3. **Condense step**: Refined prompt ‚Üí Final condensed prompt (using `CONDENSE_TEMPLATE`)

The refinement step now properly separates the "existing answer" (human foundation) from the "added data" (AI insights) as the template expects, allowing it to effectively integrate the AI responses to enhance and expand the human-based foundation while maintaining authenticity.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! The fix is complete. The issue was that the `create_human_interview_prompts()` and `combine_prompts()` function calls were incorrectly indented inside the `if issues:` block, which meant they only executed when there were configuration issues. Since the configuration validation passed (no issues), these functions never ran, so only the print statement at the end executed.
</details></think>

Perfect! I found and fixed the issue. The problem was an indentation error in the `main()` function. The calls to `create_human_interview_prompts()` and `combine_prompts()` were incorrectly indented inside the `if issues:` block, which meant they only executed when there were configuration issues.

Since your configuration validation passed (no issues found), those functions never ran - only the final success message was printed.

## What I fixed:
```python
# BEFORE (incorrect indentation):
if issues:
    print("‚ùå Configuration issues found:")
    for issue in issues:
        print(f"   - {issue}")
    sys.exit(1)

    # These were indented inside the if block!
    create_human_interview_prompts()
    combine_prompts()

# AFTER (correct indentation):
if issues:
    print("‚ùå Configuration issues found:")
    for issue in issues:
        print(f"   - {issue}")
    sys.exit(1)

# These are now outside the if block, so they run after validation passes
create_human_interview_prompts()
combine_prompts()
```

Now when you run `python prompt_creator.py`, it should properly execute the full pipeline:
1. ‚úÖ Validate configuration
2. ‚úÖ Create human interview prompts (generate ‚Üí refine ‚Üí condense)
3. ‚úÖ Combine prompts into final prompt.md

The script should now work as expected! Try running it again.

   Lines: ['Hierarchies of [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] value structure, Goal-setting and prioritization, Conflict between competing values', 'What are your top three personal values?', "Top three values right now, personally, is curiosity. I want to look at the thing that could be novel, A appreciation of boredom. Knowing that just because thoughts don't cram themselves into my peer view, that doesn't mean something's wrong. I can appreciate the time in between aha moments and epiphanies, and three, a resilient embodiment of life. Fully present, no disassociation, constant trust that sticking with something and sticking with life is most important. I refuse to make life an abstract concept that I'm just meant to solve. It's meant, life is meant for the living, and so I must live.", 'How do you prioritize between competing goals or values?', "I readily change my values as it relates to different situations. I don't compromise the values to complete a goal, but I do see that what I value makes it easier to complete a goal. And if I find that two things are competing, I start to recursively look through my mindsets and methods and reasonings behind my goals or values to try to create a little more nuance and get back into a sense of embodiment that this is a sustainable practice of not giving up goals or not giving up values to just attain and get to the next level quickly. And I'm able to do that rather quickly because I trust that things are working out in my head whether or not I'm a part of it or not, and things will appear to me. So I don't rush, I wait for the thoughts to come, and they do, and I connect the dots, and then things get a little more clear. So it's more like I trust my intuition deeply there to give me the answer, and then I backtrack and start to make them concrete as it all comes to me.", 'Can you describe a situation where you had to choose between two important values?', "Recently, I had to decide between money, a customer's project, and my value of reputation and giving people all the information they need to make a good decision. And it stressed me out because the customer was just pushing and pushing to get me to carry out this thing that they've asked me to do, but looking at the numbers, I see that it's impossible. So I looked at it and I brought that up to their attention. I said, hey, this doesn't seem like it's going to be what you think it is. It's not simply about convincing me to do it. It's about the background information that maybe isn't obvious here. So let me point it out. And I talked about why I thought things were going to be very difficult. And I wanted to make sure that they were up for the journey. And once I described it to them, gave them the hard facts of the numbers, and it showed that it would cost more than they were wanting to pay. And they were able to make a good decision and not do that. And so the frustration was I had to choose against myself, it felt like. But at the same time, I was choosing a better reputation because I didn't point them into an impossible situation and have to deal with the fallout. I was able to say, hey, this is how this is likely going to turn out. Are you sure that this is what you want? And that was very helpful. Although it's very difficult to always consider other people above myself. At some point, I would like to try to have a middle ground where I show them a better option. But unfortunately, in that case, there was just no better option. And I didn't want to do the thing anyway. But I think how I explained it was very good. It wasn't just here's all the problems that I would have to deal with if I go ahead with your plan, but I showed them that the financials didn't make sense. And they were trying to convince me and they thought I would just work it out for them in the end, but it wasn't actually possible. And so that's the nuanced explanation of all that.", '']

</details></think>

---

Perfect! The fix worked. Now it's loading all **19 Q&A sections** instead of just 18.

## What was the issue?
Entry #14 in your CSV had a malformed structure:
- **Expected format**: `Category\nGoal\nElement\nQ1\nA1\nQ2\nA2\nQ3\nA3` (9 lines)
- **Actual format**: `Combined_Category_Goal_Element\nQ1\nA1\nQ2\nA2\n(empty)` (8 lines, missing one Q&A pair)

The Category, Goal, and Element were all combined into one line, and it was missing the third question-answer pair.

## What I fixed:
I made the parsing logic more flexible to handle imperfect data:

1. **Flexible field detection**: Instead of assuming fixed positions, it now detects whether lines contain metadata (goals/elements) vs questions (starting with "What", "How", "Can")

2. **Dynamic parsing**: Extracts all valid question-answer pairs from whatever structure exists, rather than requiring exactly 9 lines

3. **Robust handling**: Still validates that entries have meaningful content, but adapts to variations in the data format

Now your script will work even with slightly inconsistent CSV formatting while still maintaining data quality. The system loaded **67,258 characters** across all 19 sections, which is more content than the previous 55,034 characters with only 18 sections.

</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've updated both `question_asker.py` and `human_interview.py` to ensure consistent CSV writing across the entire project.

## What I fixed:

**Before:** Both files were using `quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC` which quotes all non-numeric fields, potentially causing compatibility issues.

**After:** Both files now use consistent CSV writing settings from `config.py`:
- `sep=config.csv.DELIMITER` (comma)
- `quotechar=config.csv.QUOTECHAR` (double quote)  
- `quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL` (only quote fields containing special characters)

## Why this matters:

1. **Compatibility**: `prompt_creator.py` reads CSV files using `csv.DictReader` with the same delimiter and quotechar settings
2. **Consistency**: All CSV writing now uses the same parameters defined in `config.py`
3. **Robustness**: `QUOTE_MINIMAL` is more conservative and less likely to cause parsing issues than `QUOTE_NONNUMERIC`

The CSV files generated by `question_asker.py` and `human_interview.py` will now be properly readable by `prompt_creator.py` and any other parts of the system that use the centralized CSV configuration. Both scripts imported successfully, confirming the changes work correctly.

"Cognitive Structure","Operative Intelligence","Problem-solving approaches, Adaptation strategies to new situations, Transformative experiences and their impact","How do you typically approach complex problems?","Can you describe a recent situation where you had to adapt to something new?","What experience has had the most transformative impact on your thinking?","I approach complex problems typically by overthinking about them and then I like to catch myself and I start to break down all the possible options and then I think about the most likely not impossible solutions and I kind of trust my intuition on them so it's like I feel something is the right way to do it even though I don't understand it and I can't verify it it's more like an insistence that pushes me forward so I trust my gut and I start to backfill different aspects of that so I can complete the task","I tend to have to adapt to new situations quite often. Most often I don't understand how things work and I have to kind of adapt myself. It's more of that intuition where I trust my gut and start to lean into it. And I guess if I was given a precise answer of a situation, recently I had to redo the camera system at my church. And I'm doing it as a kind of volunteer work, so to not be a burden on the church's financials. And they had a pretty poor system, so the networking kind of broke every time I made any changes. We didn't have enough resources, it seemed like, to do it. They were always asking for upgrades and there was never anything in the budget to do it. But I just kind of stuck with it and did it and I'm almost finished with it now. So I'm not a typical network engineer and creating a full system like that from scratch was an ordeal. Pulling the wires and troubleshooting outdated and old equipment, thinking that maybe I did something wrong in my configuration. But it was in fact just old equipment kind of dying out or imposing improper functionality that looked like errors on my part.","A few years ago I watched a YouTube video and the title of it was life is not a problem to solve. Most of the time I wanted to experiment to solve life so that I wouldn't have to get my hands dirty. It was almost like I just wanted to figure out life so I could go on with whatever comes after life. It always felt like I had some kind of silly imposed limits on what was possible and I wanted to overcome those limits so I could finally go on with living. But what I realized is actually I was just sitting on the sidelines of life, not actually taking part in any of the experiments that I thought, I was just kind of convincing myself that I was in the right spot. And this saying, while crude, is quite motivating. If you don't live, then you just mentally masturbate your way through life, which is a silly way to exist. That was probably the most transformative impact on my thinking is that thinking is not just waiting to figure it out. It's experimenting in live real time that gets you somewhere. Thinking is the ultimate thinking and you can think while you do."                                                                    
"Cognitive Structure","Figurative Intelligence","Perceptual patterns and preferences, Language use and communication style, Mental imagery and creative expression","What patterns do you often notice in your environment?","How would you describe your communication style?","When you imagine your future, what images come to mind?","I have this strange instinctual ability to notice when something is off about an environment. So I notice very quickly if something feels weird or there's some sort of interpersonal issues or dynamics at play. I'm quite attuned to that and I notice it and I don't think many people are up to that level. So I try to do good things with this ability and not let it overcome me with anxiety. I do that by just noticing it and calling it out either mentally or verbally if it's a safe topic or thing to discuss. Maybe if I'm in sales, I just notice that somebody is just nodding their head, acting like they agree and they secretly are not agreeing and they're nervous about a situation. I just kind of note that and I'm going to ask them. It's like I saw that that makes sense. And then I say I see maybe there's a little trepidation there like what are you thinking or that didn't quite sit well with you did it to call it out. But in the past, it gave me quite a lot of anxiety and I would be apprehensive about situations that I felt I couldn't address immediately and to be stuck in that situation of something being off or unfruitful dynamic gave me some sort of pause that was hard to get over.","My communication style is very direct, and I tend to be open to ask questions and call out ideas that seem dubious or whatever. But I intentionally don't disagree with things a lot. I try to find additions to it rather than subtractions, because I like to think together. I treat everybody like they're some sort of genius, and I try to build things together with people rather than uncover all of the bullshit to get to the bottom of the thing. I like to get to the bottom of something with additions, like, oh, I see what you mean by that, and da-da-da-da-da-da. And I keep pushing in that regard rather than subtracting things away.","When I imagine my future right now, I imagine a successful business, and kids, and harmonious arrangements with all. I have often tried to reassure myself that the future won't be bad. And so I would subtract things away from my future that I thought would make it harder to attain or impossible to go. But now I'm starting to realize that things come to you. And it's not a waiting to be saved by the future, but it is a step-by-step addition. So maybe when I don't have things to do in the past, I would try to wait for something to save me. Now I start to build things, repair my fishing nets, in some sense, rather than waiting for a fisherman to come and teach me how to fish again. I think I know things now, and I trust myself a little more. But I certainly imagine the future as better, but I don't know how to get there currently."                              
"Developmental Journey","Assimilation and Accommodation","Key life experiences and their integration, Moments of cognitive dissonance and resolution, Evolution of personal beliefs and values","What life experience has most shaped who you are today?","Can you recall a time when your beliefs were significantly challenged?","How have your core values changed over time?","This seems almost like a dodge when I say it, but I experience life experiences that shape me almost daily Certainly weekly and it's hard to rank them because of how often and Extreme all of them feel I'm used to I would think of very impactful things that I've had to reassess my life about entirely There's no been no shortage of those Throughout my life, but if I had to rank something as the most impactful thing is Is not by mindset changes which happen very frequently but specific experiences that have physically changed my my life would mainly be my time at the National Pump Company where I reached a High position in the company and then was laid off. I started at the ground floor assembling the pumps and through many promotions eventually became a regional sales manager and Was moved to Nebraska to take on a new territory to take over the acquisition of a company but when that fell through I was left with a large budget of kind of impossible Tasks to accomplish Sell a lot of money in pumps and if you didn't then they were going to fire me but the the circumstances Were kind of impossible and I didn't understand that at the beginning it it felt like I had to explain that But I don't because it was just strictly impossible There was no way I could have met the budget or in the timeline given all of the other requirements That they dictated to me So I tried to do that Like it was a very hard Thing like I failed which I did but it it I Learned all that I could looking at it. Like it was my failure Entirely I didn't for a long time Imagine that there could be other parts of that situation, so I Saw all of my shortcomings and then I started to understand the shortcomings of the company as well and That started to give me a full shape of the system and what stood out as the most important thing of Sales in my regard is that I need to be okay asking for what I want and I Understand in the past I would sort of demand it that I didn't have a good way of wanting um things Getting things without demanding them. So I was kind of immature in sales that way at 23, you know and I had for for a long time that was difficult, but essentially it brought me to nebraska where I met my wife and Gave me the the starting foundation to start the business and to trust myself a little more To kind of lean into the natural individualism that I carry where I did not want to be in a position again Where somebody could fire me take away the sweat equity I put into the company which is part of it when you work for another company is Sweat isn't worth anything more than what you paid for it so the entrepreneurial journey was Quite necessary for me and I was glad that all these things had to happen to show me what it did teach me and Then also show me my non-negotiables of of that. So that's a good answer","My beliefs were significantly challenged when I was a new Christian and I based everything I did on what I thought to be objectively ethical in the Christian worldview. And I think that's a great start and it will get you far because it is quite poignant in the benefits of following an ethical life, a good name, good reputation. But there becomes a time where situations call for a more embodied and nuanced understanding of what's at play. So for an example, when any thing came up, any question came up, I would before look at it and almost as if like a child say, what would Jesus do, not take into any account the circumstances that I personally felt or my feelings on the matter, like I said, or what was right for the family, you know, the people in my circle. So a lot of times I put us into a worse position thinking that that was somehow going to benefit me in the future. And so while on one hand I had to unlearn a lot of the bad habits that I had in my previous life before Christ, it didn't mean that all of them were bad and I could trust some parts of myself that later had to be integrated. So realizing that objective ethical things does not negate subjective experience of the world and certainly doesn't require you to take the hardest path forward in life every single time.","My core values have seemed to change over my life. At the start, my young self tried to lie or cheat or steal to get whatever I want. It was less about me, but more about putting these boundaries up between me and my feelings of what I didn't have and what I thought I was able to ask for. So there was all these different masks and ways that I hid these needs of myself. Then as I became a Christian later in life, I imagined that the most important thing was the objective, morality and ethics of the world, that there was a social counter that would tip the scales in your favor and give you some sort of advantage over whatever you were dealing with so that it could put you in a better place in life if you just followed the rules and things get better for you. I realized that was an immature view and it was another way of hiding what I needed. I didn't ask for what I needed instead. I trusted that following a narrative or a worldview would, like I said, tip the scales in my favor. Recently, I've not seen it as such a negative thing to truly observe those wants and needs to try to understand where they come from and answer some of them questions directly rather than trying to put on a mask that allows me to get what I want. I just trust that I am, at my core, a good person and I could try things and I could do things and that's been quite helpful. So as a snapshot of today, the core views might look something like curiosity that I would look for what feels interesting or nascent and then a sense of embodied resilience where I stay in the situation until it works out and then of course, yeah, a fair deal of valuing boredom so that when there are times in life where things are dry or I get less motion on important projects that I stick with it and not jump about as much. So these are some core values and a good timeline of how they've changed."                                                                                             
"Developmental Journey","Stage Progression","Milestones in cognitive and emotional development, Current stage of intellectual maturity, Areas of ongoing growth and challenge","What do you consider your most significant personal growth milestone?","Where do you see yourself in terms of intellectual and emotional maturity?","What area of your life presents the biggest challenge for growth right now?","To date, my most significant personal growth milestone feels like my ability to overcome an anxious attachment style. I really leaned into a trust that I would figure things out, and eventually I did. I used to feel very anxious about the future and feel like life was something of an audition where I was trying to prove my worth, but instead I understood it as that we all have areas of life that were difficult and they're not evidence, it's just experience, it's history, it's not stacking up evidence that you're not where you're supposed to be. So that's been probably my favorite sensation when I wake up in the morning is knowing that things are perfect in this world. Even though the natural order of things have not aligned itself with what I want, the money's not there, the different areas in life that I want aren't as that they should but it feels good to get up and do things. I always kind of just push through and as I value boredom and just trusting the signal that feels right, I always had to overcompensate and to kind of reassure myself that things were okay. But now it feels like things are good and I feel in charge and things seem to come to me because of this newfound confidence and it's made my work a little easier to make decisions and decide things. I feel less overwhelmed because of a lack of knowledge or wisdom on subjects. It feels like I'm exactly where I need to be and then when things align then I'll be precisely attuned to see that and take charge of it. So it's a very good thing.","When I think of intellectual and emotional maturity, I see it in terms of being able to see other people's perspective and then to reason properly from that. I feel that I have this highly attuned system in my head that allows me to see when things are out of whack. And by out of whack, maybe I mean something is incorrectly valued by everybody else or there's some sort of emotional dynamic that people aren't picking up on. I feel like I see those and I'm attuned to them, possibly because my past feelings of depression or anxiety, I'm able to pick up on these things quite quickly. And then I try to stick with it and get to the bottom of things. So in personal relationships, where I think emotional maturity comes into play, I'm able to spot these things and have very authentic relationships with them. And then intellectually, I notice something maybe doesn't fit the graph or the curve and I say, hey, that's important. Let's stick with that until we find out what it is. And I find it very fulfilling to stick with things like that and to get to the bottom of a problem. In the past, I would feel that I was immature in not feeling or specifically in feeling like things weren't right until I got to the bottom of things. But now I just really, really enjoy the process and it feels like I'm not just proving myself as valuable to the world, but more challenging myself with these things. And the challenge feels good.","After a big stint and trying to be vulnerable with people, I've noticed that I still feel quite guarded when it comes to true love and appreciation for things. I see this as a challenge for growth, not really for the remote, the emotional dynamics, but more so the amount of work I'm willing to do for each idea. So if I loved something very deeply and went all in on something, I would never stop. I am quite intense and it feels like I give up too soon. I have a great relationship. People are now coming up to me and telling me how much they appreciate me and all these things that I'm doing. I lead a men's group and they are all so happy to see me. It's always like I'm the coolest guy in the world and everybody really loves me, but I still feel quite withdrawn and I didn't notice that until today. So I do see it as that this refusal for love is holding me back, not so much possibly to the relationship dynamics, but mainly with the system of me not giving up on things that I care about. So that's a good answer."

It's meant, life is meant for the living, and so I must live.","I readily change my values as it relates to different situations. I don't compromise the values to complete a goal, but I do see that what I value makes it easier to complete a goal. And if I find that two things are competing, I start to recursively look through my mindsets and methods and reasonings behind my goals or values to try to create a little more nuance and get back into a sense of embodiment that this is a sustainable practice of not giving up goals or not giving up values to just attain and get to the next level quickly. And I'm able to do that rather quickly because I trust that things are working out in my head whether or not I'm a part of it or not, and things will appear to me. So I don't rush, I wait for the thoughts to come, and they do, and I connect the dots, and then things get a little more clear. So it's more like I trust my intuition deeply there to give me the answer, and then I backtrack and start to make them concrete as it all comes to me.","Recently, I had to decide between money, a customer's project, and my value of reputation and giving people all the information they need to make a good decision. And it stressed me out because the customer was just pushing and pushing to get me to carry out this thing that they've asked me to do, but looking at the numbers, I see that it's impossible. So I looked at it and I brought that up to their attention. I said, hey, this doesn't seem like it's going to be what you think it is. It's not simply about convincing me to do it. It's about the background information that maybe isn't obvious here. So let me point it out. And I talked about why I thought things were going to be very difficult. And I wanted to make sure that they were up for the journey. And once I described it to them, gave them the hard facts of the numbers, and it showed that it would cost more than they were wanting to pay. And they were able to make a good decision and not do that. And so the frustration was I had to choose against myself, it felt like. But at the same time, I was choosing a better reputation because I didn't point them into an impossible situation and have to deal with the fallout. I was able to say, hey, this is how this is likely going to turn out. Are you sure that this is what you want? And that was very helpful. Although it's very difficult to always consider other people above myself. At some point, I would like to try to have a middle ground where I show them a better option. But unfortunately, in that case, there was just no better option. And I didn't want to do the thing anyway. But I think how I explained it was very good. It wasn't just here's all the problems that I would have to deal with if I go ahead with your plan, but I showed them that the financials didn't make sense. And they were trying to convince me and they thought I would just work it out for them in the end, but it wasn't actually possible. And so that's the nuanced explanation of all that."
