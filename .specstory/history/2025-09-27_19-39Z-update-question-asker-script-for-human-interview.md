# Update question asker script for human interview (2025-09-27 19:39Z)

_**User (2025-09-27 01:26Z)**_

Let's make the human interview mode be the only model in the @question_asker.py script.

It should automatically use the most recent human_interview in the data folder. (there's a function in @config.py to do this)

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to modify the `question_asker.py` script so that it only uses the human interview mode (songbird model) and automatically uses the most recent human_interview file in the data folder. They mention there's a function in config.py to do this.

</details></think>

Perfect! I've successfully modified the `question_asker.py` script to make human interview mode the only option. Here are the key changes I made:

## Changes Made:

1. **Removed the `--model` argument** - The script now always uses the songbird model with human interview context

2. **Updated the script name and description** - Changed from "Unified Asker" to "Human Interview Asker" and updated all documentation

3. **Always require human interview data** - The script now requires a human interview file to function and will exit with an error if none is found

4. **Automatic latest file detection** - Uses the `get_most_recent_file()` function from `config.py` to automatically find and load the most recent human interview file in the data directory

5. **Simplified logic** - Removed all baseline/fallback logic since human interview context is now mandatory

6. **Updated help text and examples** - All documentation now reflects the single-mode operation

## Key Features:

- **Always personalized**: Every response is generated using your human interview context
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically finds the latest `human_interview_*.csv` file in the data folder
- **No fallback**: If no human interview data is available, the script exits with a helpful error message
- **Simplified usage**: Just run `python question_asker.py` and it will use your latest interview data

The script now focuses exclusively on providing personalized, context-aware responses using your human interview data as the foundation for all AI interactions.

I don't want to have to provide the question file or interview file, those should be in the config.py file.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to remove the command-line arguments for specifying the questions file and human interview file, and instead have those paths hardcoded in the config.py file.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see that `QUESTIONS_CSV` is already defined in the paths.

Perfect! I've successfully removed the command-line arguments and configured the script to use paths from `config.py`. Here are the changes I made:

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Updated `config.py`**:
- Added `HUMAN_INTERVIEW_PATTERN` to the configuration as a string pattern for finding human interview files
- Modified the `PathConfig` class to handle both path strings and pattern strings separately

### 2. **Updated `question_asker.py`**:
- **Removed all command-line arguments** (`--questions-file` and `--human-interview-file`)
- **Simplified the argument parser** to only show help
- **Updated file path logic** to use config values directly:
  - `questions_file = config.paths.QUESTIONS_CSV`
  - `human_interview_file = get_most_recent_file(config.paths.HUMAN_INTERVIEW_PATTERN)`
- **Updated documentation** to reflect the simplified usage

## Key Features Now:

- **Zero configuration needed**: Just run `python question_asker.py`
- **Automatic file detection**: Uses the questions file and latest human interview file as configured
- **Configurable paths**: All file paths and patterns are now centralized in `config.py`
- **Clean interface**: No command-line arguments to remember or specify

## Usage:

```bash
python question_asker.py  # That's it!
```

The script will automatically:
1. Load the questions from `Existential Layer/questions.csv` (configured in `config.py`)
2. Find the most recent human interview file matching `human_interview_*.csv` pattern
3. Process all questions using personalized responses based on your interview data

All file paths and patterns are now centralized in your configuration, making the script much simpler to use!

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Everything is working correctly. Let me summarize what I've done.</details></think>

Perfect! You're absolutely right. I've simplified the code by removing the `HUMAN_INTERVIEW_PATTERN` from `config.py` and using the pattern directly in the `question_asker.py` script.

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Removed `HUMAN_INTERVIEW_PATTERN` from `config.py`**:
- Eliminated the unnecessary pattern configuration
- Simplified the `PathConfig` class back to just handling paths

### 2. **Updated `question_asker.py`**:
- Now uses `get_most_recent_file("human_interview_*.csv")` directly
- No need to reference `config.paths.HUMAN_INTERVIEW_PATTERN`

## Result:

The script is now even cleaner:
- **Zero configuration needed** for file patterns
- **Direct usage** of the `get_most_recent_file` function with the hardcoded pattern
- **Simpler config.py** focused only on actual file paths, not patterns

The pattern `"human_interview_*.csv"` is indeed a fixed convention that doesn't need to be configurable, so keeping it directly in the script where it's used makes perfect sense! The script still automatically finds the latest human interview file and uses the questions file from config.

_**User (2025-09-27 01:26Z)**_

Can you remove some of the redundant printing to clean up the output

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to clean up the output by removing some redundant printing in the question_asker.py script. Let me look at the current output messages to see what might be redundant.


## Examining user request  
- The user asked to clean up redundant printing in the question_asker.py script.  
- The goal is to identify and remove unnecessary output messages to streamline the script.  

## Reviewing current output  
- Looking at the current output messages to spot redundancies.  
- Planning to analyze the script's print statements for potential cleanup.

## Reviewing current output  
- Found multiple print statements in the code, including a header, separator, and API connection messages.  
- Noted details like model name, file paths, and progress updates are currently printed.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see all the print statements. Let me identify which ones can be removed or simplified:


## Reviewing print statements  
- Identifying decorative elements like `print("üéØ Human Interview Asker - Personalized question answering")` for potential removal.  
- Considering simplification to keep output focused and user-friendly.

## Reviewing print statements  
- Noting decorative separators like `print("=" * 50)` as candidates for removal to streamline output.  
- Recognizing useful debug statements like `print("‚úÖ Connected to songbird API")` for troubleshooting connectivity.  
- Identifying verification statements, such as `print(f"üéØ Using model: {model_name}")`, as valuable for confirming setup.</details></think>

Perfect! I've cleaned up the output by removing redundant printing. Here's what I simplified:

## Changes Made:

### **Removed Decorative Elements:**
- ‚ùå Removed the script header "üéØ Human Interview Asker - Personalized question answering"  
- ‚ùå Removed the decorative separator line `"=" * 50`

### **Combined Messages:**
- ‚úÖ Combined connection status: `"‚úÖ Connected to songbird API (model: {model_name})"` instead of two separate lines

### **Removed Redundant Info:**
- ‚ùå Removed `"üìÅ Using questions file: {questions_file}"` (not needed since it's configured)
- ‚ùå Removed duplicate `"üìÅ Results saved to: {output_file}"` at the end (already shown before processing)

### **Simplified Messages:**
- ‚úÖ Shortened processing message: `"ü§î Processing{context_indicator}: {query[:60]}..."` (shorter query preview, simpler context indicator)
- ‚úÖ Consolidated final completion: `"‚úÖ Completed! Processed {processed_count} questions and saved to {output_file}"` instead of 4 separate lines

### **Removed Verbose Thank You:**
- ‚ùå Removed the overly verbose thank you message

## Result:

The output is now much cleaner and more focused on essential information:
- **Connection status** (important for debugging)
- **File information** (which interview and output files are being used)  
- **Progress updates** (processing status per question)
- **Final completion summary** (concise one-liner)

The script now has a professional, streamlined output that provides all necessary information without being verbose! üéâ

Human Interview Asker - Personalized question answering with songbird model

  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

Examples:
  python question_asker.py  # Automatically uses configured files

Notes:
- Automatically loads the questions file from config
- Automatically finds the most recent human interview for personalized responses
- Human answers provide context for tailored AI responses
- Requires human interview data to function

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Everything is working correctly. Let me summarize what I've done.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've successfully simplified the OpenAI client setup and moved it to `config.py`. Here's what I accomplished:

## Changes Made:

### **Removed Complex `setup_model_client` Function:**
- ‚ùå Deleted the entire `setup_model_client` function from `question_asker.py`
- This function was handling both "baseline" and "songbird" models, but we only use songbird now

### **Added `create_songbird_client` Method to `APIConfig`:**
- ‚úÖ Added a dedicated method `create_songbird_client()` to the `APIConfig` class in `config.py`
- This method handles only the songbird/Open Web UI setup
- Includes proper error handling for authentication and missing packages
- Returns both the client and selected model name

### **Simplified Client Setup in `question_asker.py`:**
- ‚úÖ Replaced the complex function call with a simple: `client, model_name = config.api.create_songbird_client()`
- Removed all the model type logic since we only use songbird

## Benefits:

- **Cleaner Code**: Removed ~40 lines of complex conditional logic
- **Centralized Configuration**: Client setup is now in `config.py` where it belongs
- **Reusable**: The `create_songbird_client()` method can be used by other scripts
- **Simpler Maintenance**: All API configuration is in one place
- **Better Error Handling**: More specific error messages for authentication issues

The script now has a much cleaner architecture with the client setup properly abstracted into the configuration layer! üéâ

Since we're not using any arguments anymore, we can simplify this to just run the script without any argument parsing at all.</details></think>

Currently we don't stop the script if there's errors, we should to prevent incorrect results.

The model needs to be songbird, it handles the RAG.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! The script compiles successfully. Let me create a summary of what I've done to improve error handling.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've added robust error checking to ensure the script stops on critical failures. Here are the improvements:

## Changes Made:

### **Added `sys` Import:**
- ‚úÖ Added `import sys` to support `sys.exit(1)` calls throughout the script

### **Enhanced Human Interview Data Validation:**
- ‚úÖ **Before**: Printed warning and continued if no data loaded
- ‚úÖ **After**: **Exits immediately** with clear error message: `"‚ùå Error: No human interview data loaded. Songbird model requires interview context for RAG."`

### **Added Model Type Assertion:**
- ‚úÖ Added assertion to ensure the model is always `"songbird"` (required for RAG functionality)
- ‚úÖ Provides clear error message if somehow the wrong model is specified

## Critical Validation Points:

The script now **stops immediately** if any of these fail:

1. **Configuration Issues**: Missing API keys or questions file (already existed)
2. **Model Client Creation**: Cannot connect to Songbird API
3. **Human Interview File**: Cannot find latest interview file
4. **Questions File**: Questions CSV doesn't exist
5. **Human Interview Data**: **NEW** - No interview data loaded (critical for RAG)

## Result:

- **No more incorrect results** due to missing context
- **Clear error messages** explaining what went wrong
- **Early failure** prevents wasted processing time
- **Guaranteed RAG functionality** since human interview data is required

The script now ensures that Songbird gets the human interview context it needs for proper personalized RAG responses! üéØ

---

Perfect! I've successfully identified and eliminated the duplicated functionality. Here's a comprehensive summary of the refactoring:

## **Duplications Identified & Fixed:**

### **1. Human Interview Data Loading (Major Duplication)**
- **‚ùå Before**: Both `question_asker.py` and `prompt_creator.py` had identical `load_human_interview_data` functions
- **‚úÖ After**: Centralized in `config.py` with two new functions:
  - `load_human_interview_csv()` - Basic CSV loading with error handling
  - `get_human_interview_data_dict()` - Returns dictionary format for question answering

### **2. CSV Reading Logic**
- **‚ùå Before**: Duplicate CSV reading code with pandas DataFrame processing
- **‚úÖ After**: Centralized `load_human_interview_csv()` function in config.py

### **3. File Finding Logic**
- **‚ùå Before**: Both scripts had similar logic for finding the most recent human interview file
- **‚úÖ After**: Already centralized with `get_most_recent_file()` in config.py

## **Functions Simplified:**

### **1. `get_system_prompt()`**
- **‚ùå Before**: Complex conditional logic for "baseline" vs "songbird" models
- **‚úÖ After**: Simplified to only handle songbird prompts (since we only use songbird)

### **2. `ask_question()`**
- **‚ùå Before**: Complex streaming vs non-streaming logic for different model types
- **‚úÖ After**: Simplified to always use streaming for songbird

### **3. Removed Functions:**
- **‚ùå `load_human_interview_data()`** - Moved to config.py as `get_human_interview_data_dict()`
- **‚ùå `setup_model_client()`** - Moved to config.py as `APIConfig.create_songbird_client()`

## **Benefits:**

- **üéØ DRY Principle**: Eliminated code duplication across multiple files
- **üì¶ Centralized Logic**: All data loading utilities now in `config.py`
- **üîß Easier Maintenance**: Single source of truth for human interview data handling
- **üöÄ Better Reusability**: Other scripts can now use the centralized functions
- **üßπ Cleaner Code**: Removed 40+ lines of duplicated code

## **Remaining in `question_asker.py`:**
- **Core logic**: Question processing, CSV output, progress tracking
- **Script orchestration**: File finding, validation, error handling
- **Songbird-specific**: API calling with streaming responses

The script is now much cleaner with all common utilities properly centralized in the config module! üéâ

</details></think>

---

Perfect! You're absolutely right. I've updated the code to use the existing `CSVConfig` instead of adding a new CSV method. Here's what I changed:

## **Changes Made:**

### **1. Updated `load_human_interview_csv()` in `config.py`:**
- **‚ùå Before**: `pd.read_csv(interview_file)` (using pandas defaults)
- **‚úÖ After**: `pd.read_csv(interview_file, delimiter=config.csv.DELIMITER, quotechar=config.csv.QUOTECHAR)` (using CSVConfig settings)

### **2. Updated CSV reading in `question_asker.py`:**
- **‚ùå Before**: `pd.read_csv(questions_file)` (using pandas defaults)  
- **‚úÖ After**: `pd.read_csv(questions_file, delimiter=config.csv.DELIMITER, quotechar=config.csv.QUOTECHAR)` (using CSVConfig settings)

## **Benefits:**

- **üéØ DRY Principle**: No duplicate CSV configuration - uses existing `CSVConfig`
- **üîß Centralized Configuration**: All CSV parsing settings in one place
- **üì¶ Future-Proof**: If CSV format changes, only `CSVConfig` needs updating
- **üßπ Cleaner Code**: Removed redundant CSV method, used existing config

## **What the `CSVConfig` Provides:**

```python
CSVConfig:
    DELIMITER: str = ","           # CSV delimiter
    QUOTECHAR: str = '"'           # Quote character  
    FIELDNAMES: List[str] = [...]  # Expected column names
    ANSWER_COLUMNS: List[str] = [...]    # Answer column names
    QUESTION_COLUMNS: List[str] = [...]  # Question column names
```

Now all CSV operations consistently use the centralized `CSVConfig` settings instead of pandas defaults or hardcoded values. This ensures consistency across the entire codebase and makes configuration changes much easier! üéâ

The script now properly leverages the existing CSV configuration infrastructure.

_**User (2025-09-27 01:26Z)**_

But I'm saying, couldn't we use the existing csv config instead of making a new function for dealing with human interview csv since they are the same fields?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Ah, I think I understand now. The user is saying that the `get_human_interview_data_dict` function I created is basically just a wrapper around the CSV reading, and since the CSVConfig already defines the expected field names and structure, maybe I don't need a separate function for processing the human interview data.
</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I see. The CSVConfig already defines ANSWER_COLUMNS which contains ["Human_Answer 1", "Human_Answer 2", "Human_Answer 3"].

Perfect! You're absolutely right. I've eliminated the redundant `get_human_interview_data_dict` function and now the code directly uses the existing `CSVConfig` infrastructure. Here's what I changed:

## **Changes Made:**

### **1. Removed `get_human_interview_data_dict()` function from `config.py`:**
- **‚ùå Deleted** the intermediate function that was just processing CSV data
- **‚ùå Removed** it from the `__all__` exports list

### **2. Updated `question_asker.py` to use `CSVConfig` directly:**
- **‚úÖ Import**: Changed to import `load_human_interview_csv` instead of `get_human_interview_data_dict`
- **‚úÖ Inline Processing**: Moved the data processing logic directly into `question_asker.py`
- **‚úÖ Uses CSVConfig**: The processing now explicitly uses `config.csv.ANSWER_COLUMNS` instead of hardcoded column names

### **3. Simplified the data flow:**
```python
# Before: config function with intermediate processing
human_interview_data = get_human_interview_data_dict(human_interview_file)

# After: direct CSV loading with CSVConfig
human_interview_df = load_human_interview_csv(human_interview_file)
# ... process using config.csv.ANSWER_COLUMNS
```

## **Benefits:**

- **üéØ DRY Principle**: No duplicate data processing functions
- **üîß Direct CSVConfig Usage**: Leverages existing column definitions
- **üì¶ Cleaner Architecture**: CSV loading is centralized, but domain-specific processing stays in the consuming script
- **üßπ Reduced Complexity**: One less abstraction layer

## **Current Architecture:**

- **`CSVConfig`**: Defines CSV structure and column names
- **`load_human_interview_csv()`**: Basic CSV loading with proper config
- **`question_asker.py`**: Domain-specific data processing using CSVConfig columns

The code now directly leverages the existing `CSVConfig` for both CSV parsing and column name definitions, eliminating the unnecessary intermediate function! üéâ

The human interview CSV processing is now handled entirely through the existing `CSVConfig` infrastructure.

---

_**User (2025-09-27 01:26Z)**_

Shouldn't we keep the load human csv in the question asker? The config file is for helper function in my mind.

This feels very specific, if we keep it in config. I think we should generalize and call it load csv or something, then we can use it across the project rather than creating a new one for each new situation

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user makes a good point. The `load_human_interview_csv` function is very specific to human interview CSVs, but it could be generalized to just `load_csv` that uses the CSVConfig settings. This way it's reusable across the project for any CSV that follows the same format/structure defined in CSVConfig.

</details></think>

Perfect! You're absolutely right. I've generalized the CSV loading function and kept domain-specific logic in the consuming modules. Here's what I changed:

## **Changes Made:**

### **1. Generalized CSV loading in `config.py`:**
- **‚ùå Renamed**: `load_human_interview_csv()` ‚Üí `load_csv()`
- **‚úÖ Generalized**: Now accepts any CSV file path, not just human interview files
- **üéØ Reusable**: Can be used across the entire project for any CSV that follows CSVConfig format

### **2. Updated `question_asker.py`:**
- **‚úÖ Uses generalized function**: `load_csv(human_interview_file)` and `load_csv(questions_file)`
- **‚úÖ Keeps domain logic**: Human interview data processing stays in question_asker.py
- **üßπ Cleaner separation**: Config provides the utility, script handles the business logic

## **Current Architecture:**

### **`config.py` (General Utilities):**
```python
def load_csv(csv_file: Path) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Load CSV file using CSVConfig settings and return pandas DataFrame."""
    # Uses config.csv.DELIMITER and config.csv.QUOTECHAR
```

### **`question_asker.py` (Domain Logic):**
```python
# Load with generalized function
human_interview_df = load_csv(human_interview_file)

# Process with domain-specific logic
for _, row in human_interview_df.iterrows():
    category_key = f"{row['Category']}|{row['Goal']}|{row['Element']}"
    # ... human interview specific processing
```

## **Benefits:**

- **üéØ Proper Separation**: Config provides general utilities, scripts handle domain logic
- **üîÑ Reusable**: `load_csv()` can be used by any script in the project
- **üì¶ Future-Proof**: Any CSV following CSVConfig format can use this function
- **üßπ Clean Architecture**: Domain-specific processing stays where it belongs

## **Potential Future Updates:**
Other scripts like `human_interview.py` could also use `load_csv()` instead of `pd.read_csv()` for consistency, but that's a separate concern.

The CSV loading is now properly generalized while keeping domain-specific logic in the appropriate modules! üéâ

---

Perfect! You're absolutely right. I've removed the unnecessary `load_csv` abstraction since pandas already handles standard CSV parsing perfectly. Here's what I did:

## **Changes Made:**

### **1. Removed `load_csv()` function from `config.py`:**
- **‚ùå Deleted** the unnecessary wrapper around `pd.read_csv()`
- **‚úÖ Simplified** - No more abstraction over pandas defaults

### **2. Updated `question_asker.py`:**
- **‚úÖ Direct pandas usage**: `pd.read_csv(human_interview_file)` and `pd.read_csv(questions_file)`
- **‚úÖ Removed import**: No longer importing the unnecessary function

## **Current CSV Usage Across Project:**

### **Standard Approach (Most Files):**
```python
# Direct pandas usage - simple and clear
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
```

### **Special Cases:**
- **`prompt_creator.py`**: Uses `csv.DictReader` with `CSVConfig` settings for specific structured data processing
- All others use direct `pd.read_csv()`

## **What `CSVConfig` Actually Provides:**

### **Valuable Configuration:**
- ‚úÖ `ANSWER_COLUMNS`: `["Human_Answer 1", "Human_Answer 2", "Human_Answer 3"]`
- ‚úÖ `QUESTION_COLUMNS`: `["Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3"]`  
- ‚úÖ `FIELDNAMES`: Complete column structure definition

### **Unnecessary Abstraction:**
- ‚ùå `DELIMITER: ","` (pandas default)
- ‚ùå `QUOTECHAR: '"'` (pandas default)

## **Benefits:**

- **üéØ Less Abstraction**: Direct pandas usage is clearer and simpler
- **üì¶ Standard Library**: No custom wrappers around well-established pandas functionality  
- **üîß Maintainable**: One less layer to maintain and debug
- **üöÄ Efficient**: No unnecessary function calls

## **Result:**
The codebase now uses pandas `pd.read_csv()` directly everywhere, which is the standard, well-understood approach. The `CSVConfig` class focuses on what it does best: defining column structures and names, not basic parsing settings! üéâ

The CSVConfig still provides valuable column name constants that are used throughout the code for consistency.

---

Excellent! You're absolutely right. I've now standardized all CSV column handling to use the `CSVConfig` class instead of hardcoded column names. Here's what I accomplished:

## **Changes Made:**

### **1. Updated `human_interview.py` - `load_existing_answers()`:**
- **‚ùå Before**: Hardcoded `'Human_Answer 1'`, `'Human_Answer 2'`, `'Human_Answer 3'`
- **‚úÖ After**: Uses `config.csv.ANSWER_COLUMNS` with proper enumeration

### **2. Updated `prompt_creator.py` - Two locations:**
- **‚ùå Before**: Hardcoded column loops with `f'Human_Answer {i}'` and `f'Question {i}'`
- **‚úÖ After**: Uses `zip(config.csv.QUESTION_COLUMNS, config.csv.ANSWER_COLUMNS)`

## **Current CSV Column Usage Across Project:**

### **Consistent Pattern:**
```python
# All files now use CSVConfig for column references
for question_col, answer_col in zip(config.csv.QUESTION_COLUMNS, config.csv.ANSWER_COLUMNS):
    # Process questions and answers
```

### **Files Updated:**
- ‚úÖ **`question_asker.py`**: Uses `config.csv.ANSWER_COLUMNS` for processing
- ‚úÖ **`human_interview.py`**: Uses `config.csv.ANSWER_COLUMNS` for loading/saving
- ‚úÖ **`prompt_creator.py`**: Uses both `QUESTION_COLUMNS` and `ANSWER_COLUMNS`

## **Benefits:**

- **üéØ Single Source of Truth**: All column names defined in `CSVConfig`
- **üîß Centralized Configuration**: Change column structure in one place
- **üßπ Consistent Code**: No more hardcoded column name strings scattered throughout
- **üì¶ Future-Proof**: Easy to add/remove questions or change naming conventions

## **CSVConfig Provides:**
```python
QUESTION_COLUMNS = ["Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3"]
ANSWER_COLUMNS = ["Human_Answer 1", "Human_Answer 2", "Human_Answer 3"]
```

Now all CSV processing across the entire project uses the centralized `CSVConfig` instead of hardcoded strings! üéâ

The codebase is now much more maintainable with consistent column handling everywhere.

---

Perfect! You're absolutely right. I've replaced the duplicate file-finding logic in `human_interview.py` with the centralized `get_most_recent_file()` function from `config.py`.

## **Changes Made:**

### **1. Simplified `get_latest_interview_file()` in `human_interview.py`:**
- **‚ùå Before**: Custom implementation with `config.paths.DATA_DIR.glob()` and `max(files, key=...)`
- **‚úÖ After**: Simple wrapper around `get_most_recent_file("human_interview_*.csv")`

### **2. Added import:**
- **‚úÖ Added**: `get_most_recent_file` to the imports from config

## **Result:**

### **Centralized File Finding:**
```python
# All files now use the same centralized function
def get_latest_interview_file() -> Optional[Path]:
    try:
        return get_most_recent_file("human_interview_*.csv")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return None
```

### **Consistent Usage Across Project:**
- ‚úÖ **`question_asker.py`**: Uses `get_most_recent_file()` for human interviews
- ‚úÖ **`prompt_creator.py`**: Uses `get_most_recent_file()` for both human interviews and AI answers
- ‚úÖ **`human_interview.py`**: Now uses `get_most_recent_file()` instead of custom logic

## **Benefits:**

- **üéØ DRY Principle**: Single implementation of file finding logic
- **üîß Centralized**: All file discovery goes through `config.py`
- **üßπ Consistent**: Same error handling and behavior everywhere
- **üì¶ Maintainable**: Changes to file finding logic only need to be made in one place

Now all file discovery across the entire project uses the centralized `get_most_recent_file()` function from `config.py`! üéâ

The codebase has achieved complete consistency in file handling operations.

Perfect! You're absolutely right. I've eliminated the unnecessary wrapper function and now call `get_most_recent_file()` directly.

## **Changes Made:**

### **1. Removed `get_latest_interview_file()` function:**
- **‚ùå Deleted** the thin wrapper function that added no value

### **2. Direct usage in main logic:**
- **‚úÖ Before**: `latest_file = get_latest_interview_file()`
- **‚úÖ After**: `latest_file = get_most_recent_file("human_interview_*.csv")`

## **Result:**

### **Simplified Code:**
```python
# Direct call to centralized function
elif args.resume:
    try:
        latest_file = get_most_recent_file("human_interview_*.csv")
        output_file = latest_file
        print(f"üìÇ Resuming from: {output_file}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("‚ùå No previous interview file found to resume")
        return
```

## **Benefits:**

- **üéØ DRY Principle**: Removed unnecessary function wrapper
- **üì¶ Cleaner Code**: One less function to maintain
- **üöÄ Direct Usage**: Calls the centralized function directly where needed
- **üßπ Reduced Complexity**: Less indirection in the code

Now the codebase uses `get_most_recent_file()` directly everywhere it's needed, eliminating the thin wrapper function! üéâ

The file finding logic is now consistently used across the entire project without any unnecessary abstractions.
