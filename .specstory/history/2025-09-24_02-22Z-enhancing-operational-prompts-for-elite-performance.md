# Enhancing operational prompts for elite performance (2025-09-24 02:22Z)

_**User (2025-09-24 02:22Z)**_

Let's finish this @README.md to incorporate these key values that top operational prompt have:

```
Your system prompt is already in the top 5-10% for personalized AI systems due to its tailored focus on gut-driven action, real-time experimentation, and value-aligned decision-making, as discussed earlier. However, to reach the **top 1%** of personalized AI systems—those used by elite performers (e.g., tech CEOs, high-output creatives, or hyper-productive teams)—it could incorporate a few additional elements that these systems often include. Drawing on your preference for structured workflows, rapid execution, and autonomy (as seen in your focus on clear deliverables and controlled scope), here’s what your prompt might be missing compared to the top 1%:

### 1. **Integration of Advanced Automation Tools**
   - **Top 1% Trait**: Elite systems integrate directly with external tools (e.g., APIs for Zapier, GitHub, Notion) to automate repetitive tasks, execute code, or pull real-time data (e.g., market trends, user analytics). They often include pre-built workflows for specific domains (e.g., web dev, marketing).
   - **Your Prompt’s Gap**: It focuses on cognitive processes (e.g., breaking tasks into subtasks, gamifying) but lacks explicit instructions for interfacing with tools or automating outputs (e.g., deploying a website via Vercel). This limits end-to-end task completion.
   - **Fix**: Add instructions for agents to suggest API calls or tool integrations (e.g., “Propose a Zapier workflow to automate user feedback collection for the website”).

### 2. **Domain-Specific Expertise**
   - **Top 1% Trait**: Elite prompts embed deep domain knowledge (e.g., coding frameworks, financial modeling) to produce precise, context-aware outputs. For example, a top-tier prompt for web development might include React best practices or SEO optimization rules.
   - **Your Prompt’s Gap**: It’s broad and value-driven (e.g., faith, communal genius), which is great for ideation but less effective for technical precision (e.g., writing optimized JavaScript). For your website project, it might suggest “test a layout” but not “use Tailwind CSS for responsive design.”
   - **Fix**: Include a modular section for domain-specific guidelines (e.g., “For web tasks, prioritize frameworks like Next.js; output sample code snippets”).

### 3. **Predictive Analytics and Feedback Loops**
   - **Top 1% Trait**: Leading systems use predictive models to anticipate user needs or market shifts, incorporating feedback loops to refine outputs (e.g., “Based on last week’s user data, adjust the CTA button”). They track metrics like task completion rates or ROI.
   - **Your Prompt’s Gap**: While it tracks progress via user feedback (e.g., “user reports of forward insistence”), it doesn’t leverage predictive analytics or quantitative metrics (e.g., “Increase site conversion by 10%”). This limits proactive optimization.
   - **Fix**: Add a directive to analyze past task outcomes or external data (e.g., “Use website analytics to suggest A/B tests for user engagement”).

### 4. **Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination**
   - **Top 1% Trait**: Elite systems define clear roles for multiple agents (e.g., one for UX design, another for backend logic) with protocols for handoffs and conflict resolution. They scale across complex projects via dynamic role assignment.
   - **Your Prompt’s Gap**: It supports collaboration (e.g., “treat others as geniuses”) but doesn’t specify how agents divide labor or sync outputs for a project like a website. This could lead to redundant or misaligned suggestions.
   - **Fix**: Include a framework for agent roles (e.g., “Agent 1: Design ideation; Agent 2: Code implementation; sync via shared task board”).

### 5. **Hyper-Optimized Time Efficiency**
   - **Top 1% Trait**: Top systems ruthlessly prioritize time-to-value, often embedding timeboxing or OKR-style metrics (e.g., “Complete task in 2 hours; measure impact by X”). They align with users like Elon Musk, who you’ve referenced for urgency, by minimizing latency in decision-to-action cycles.
   - **Your Prompt’s Gap**: While it emphasizes real-time experimentation, it doesn’t explicitly enforce strict time constraints or prioritize high-impact tasks (e.g., “Focus on features driving 80% of user value”). This could slow down website completion.
   - **Fix**: Add a timeboxing rule (e.g., “Suggest tasks completable in <4 hours; prioritize based on Pareto impact”).

### Why These Matter for Your Website
For your goal of building a website, the top 1% systems would enable agents to:
- Automate deployment (e.g., push code to GitHub).
- Output precise code snippets or SEO strategies.
- Predict user behavior (e.g., “Users prefer minimalist designs; test a single-page layout”).
- Coordinate roles (e.g., one agent designs UI, another optimizes backend).
- Deliver high-impact features fast (e.g., “Launch MVP in 48 hours”).
```

We want to generalize that information as industry standards and write a section for the types of hidden rules a person uses when working.

Currently, The existential layer prompt excels at ideation and motivation but needs these technical and efficiency layers to match elite systems. It’s already close—tweaking it to include tool integration and domain specificity could push it into the top 1%.

The operational layer fills in the gaps of the existential layer

+ ## Bridging to Elite Performance: Incorporating Top 1% Traits
+ 
+ To elevate our personalized AI system to the top 1%—as used by elite performers like tech CEOs and high-output teams—we generalize key industry standards from top operational prompts. These standards address gaps in ideation-focused systems by adding technical precision, efficiency, and automation. Below, we outline these standards and how they manifest as "hidden rules" that people unconsciously apply in their work—rules we aim to capture and encode in our datasets for training.
+ 
+ ### Hidden Rules in Personal Workflows
+ People develop implicit "rules" based on experience, habits, and domain knowledge that guide their daily tasks. These might include shortcuts like "always check email responsiveness on mobile first" or "prioritize tasks by ROI before diving in." Our operational layer extracts these from loaders (emails, code, reports, etc.) to create datasets that teach AI these nuances, making it feel like an extension of the user's mind.
+ 
+ ### 1. Integration of Advanced Automation Tools
+    - **Industry Standard**: Top systems integrate with tools like APIs, Zapier, or GitHub for seamless automation, enabling end-to-end task completion.
+    - **Hidden Rule Example**: "If a task repeats, automate it—e.g., set up a script to deploy code changes automatically."
+    - **Implementation in Dataset**: Loaders process work artifacts to identify automation patterns, generating prompt examples that suggest tool integrations.
+ 
+ ### 2. Domain-Specific Expertise
+    - **Industry Standard**: Embed deep knowledge in areas like coding (e.g., React best practices) or reporting (e.g., SEO rules).
+    - **Hidden Rule Example**: "For web dev, use Tailwind for quick styling and ensure accessibility from the start."
+    - **Implementation in Dataset**: Differentiate data by area (work, personal) and purpose, creating specialized examples for precise outputs.
+ 
+ ### 3. Predictive Analytics and Feedback Loops
+    - **Industry Standard**: Use data to predict needs and refine via metrics like task ROI or user engagement.
+    - **Hidden Rule Example**: "Review past reports to spot patterns—e.g., if conversions dropped, A/B test CTAs."
+    - **Implementation in Dataset**: Process artifacts into feedback-aware examples, teaching AI to suggest optimizations based on historical data.
+ 
+ ### 4. Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination
+    - **Industry Standard**: Define roles for agents (e.g., one for design, one for implementation) with clear handoffs.
+    - **Hidden Rule Example**: "Break projects into roles: brainstorm alone, then collaborate on execution."
+    - **Implementation in Dataset**: Generate examples showing coordinated outputs, like dividing a report into sections handled by different "agents."
+ 
+ ### 5. Hyper-Optimized Time Efficiency
+    - **Industry Standard**: Enforce timeboxing and Pareto prioritization for rapid value delivery.
+    - **Hidden Rule Example**: "Tackle the 20% of tasks that yield 80% results first, within strict time limits."
+    - **Implementation in Dataset**: Include timing and priority metadata in processed data, training AI to suggest efficient, high-impact actions.
+ 
+ ### Filling Gaps in the Existential Layer
+ The existential layer excels at ideation and motivation (e.g., value-aligned decision-making and real-time experimentation) but lacks technical depth and efficiency. This operational layer fills those gaps by providing datasets that infuse domain expertise, automation, and predictive capabilities, creating a complete system for elite performance. For instance, while the existential prompt might inspire a website idea, the operational dataset enables precise code completion, automated deployment, and data-driven refinements.

I've updated the README.md in the Operational Layer to incorporate the key values from top operational prompts. I generalized them as industry standards, added a new section discussing "hidden rules" that people use in their workflows (with examples tied to our dataset creation process), and explained how this layer bridges the gaps in the existential layer's focus on ideation and motivation by adding technical, efficiency, and automation elements.

If this matches what you had in mind or needs any tweaks, let me know!

_**User (2025-09-24 02:22Z)**_

Good, but we need to mention that we are reviewing the user's work to extract their hidden rules. Instead of just breeding them in artifically.

These rules should be examples of what we might find in top performers

It's too wordy, it needs to be scannable and has to have a point to stay on the page.

Only keep what people will actually read. The table is a good example of the amount of words to keep
