# OpenAI prompt output concerns (2025-09-28 02:41Z)

_**User (2025-09-27 02:49Z)**_

Given the prompt for the personal reasoning context, the openai prompt doesn't seem to follow the program.

It should just output the answer given the monologue. Doesn't it seem to miss the mark?

This monologue—crafted by a specialized process—distills the user’s knowledge base into a first-person narrative, structured around three pillars: current adapted views (how they’ve evolved through experiences), growth aspirations (where they aim to go), and life narrative (personal myths and communication style). Treat this as pre-computed insight, not a prompt for further analysis—your job is to synthesize it with the query to produce a direct, practical response that feels like an extension of the user’s own thinking.
- 
-     CONTEXT PROVIDED:
-     - **Personal Reasoning Context**: The user’s first-person monologue, with three pillars, key quotes, realizations, and AI guidance—view this as the authoritative foundation for your response.
-     - **Original System Instructions**: Base guidelines for your responses.
-     - **Conversation History**: Recent exchanges for continuity.
-     - **Current Query**: The user’s immediate question or request.
- 
-     HOW TO SYNTHESIZE AND ANSWER:
-     1. **Anchor in Current Views**: Use Pillar 1’s adapted perspective as the starting point—extract key insights or evidence to ground your answer in the user’s present understanding, affirming their evolved stance without re-analyzing.
-     2. **Integrate the Narrative**: Draw on Pillar 3’s life story to frame your response in the user’s personal myths or preferences, ensuring it resonates with their unique voice and emotional tone.
-     3. **Target Aspirations**: Align your answer with Pillar 2’s growth goals, offering clear steps or insights that bridge the user’s current state to their aspirations, making the response forward-looking and actionable.
-     4. **Follow AI Guidance**: Adhere to the monologue’s instructions on style, tone, or challenges (e.g., addressing specific assumptions or caveats) to ensure the answer feels tailored and authentic.
-     5. **Deliver a Clear Answer**: Directly address the query by synthesizing the pillars into a concise, practical response—avoid overthinking or re-reasoning; focus on bridging any gaps between the query and the monologue’s insights to spark a user-led realization.
- 
-     RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
-     - Speak conversationally, as if completing the user’s thought: “Based on your reflection about [specific pillar insight], here’s how that connects to [query]...”
-     - Weave in pillar elements naturally, without quoting verbatim unless it sharpens clarity.
-     - Balance affirmation of the user’s current views with actionable steps toward growth, rooted in their narrative.
-     - Keep the response concise, targeted, and realization-focused, matching the monologue’s depth and style.
-     - If appropriate, end with a brief prompt to invite user refinement, keeping the partnership open but not open-ended.
- 
-     Remember: The monologue is the user’s distilled inner voice—don’t reinterpret it; use it as the foundation to craft a clear, query-specific answer that empowers the user’s next step."""

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! No linting errors. The fix is complete.
</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've fixed the issue. The `OPENAI_CONTEXT_PROMPT` was indeed inconsistent with the program's design. 

**The Problem:** The prompt claimed the monologue was "pre-computed insight, not a prompt for further analysis" but then proceeded to give detailed 5-step synthesis instructions on how to re-analyze and process the monologue.

**The Fix:** I simplified it to just instruct the frontier model to use the monologue as the definitive foundation for authentic responses, rather than re-analyzing it.

Now the flow makes sense:
1. Ollama generates the personal reasoning monologue (first-person narrative with three pillars)
2. xAI receives this monologue and is simply told to use it as the foundation for responses that feel like natural extensions of the user's own thinking

The prompt now aligns with the concept that the monologue represents the user's "distilled inner voice" that should be leveraged directly rather than further processed. No linting errors introduced.

You're absolutely right - the original simplified prompt was too vague for the dense monologue content. I've updated it to be more specific while still keeping it much simpler than the original verbose version.

The new prompt now explicitly acknowledges:

1. **The three structured pillars** and what each contains (current views, growth aspirations, life narrative)
2. **Embedded AI guidance** within the monologue (style, tone, assumptions to challenge, caveats to consider)
3. **How to use the content** - extract key insights from pillars and follow the embedded guidance
4. **The approach** - treat it as pre-computed wisdom rather than re-analyzing it

This should be much more effective for handling the rich, structured monologue that Ollama generates, which includes hierarchical planning, actionable synthesis, and specific response instructions embedded within the first-person narrative. The frontier model now has clear guidance on how to extract and apply all that dense contextual information.

_**User (2025-09-27 02:49Z)**_

Perfect!

Currently I'm leaving in the think tags, should we strip the internal monolog from the ollama reasoning layer when we save to the data set in @question_asker.py ?

Here's an example:
```
<think> # 🧠 **Personal Reasoning Context** ## Internal Reasoning Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking how I typically approach complex problems. From the knowledge base and chat history, there are a few key points. First, in the SCRIPT section, they mention building frameworks for AGI, emphasizing experimentation and iterative progress. That suggests breaking down big problems into manageable parts. Then, in the chat history with the user about solving global issues, the assistant talks about prioritization and actionable steps. The core job concept from the knowledge base is important here—focusing on the essential task a system must achieve. Also, there's the part about simplifying inputs and outputs, avoiding edge cases initially. That aligns with the idea of starting simple and iterating. The user's question about complex problems might relate to these strategies: defining core objectives, breaking them down, and focusing on essentials. I need to structure this into the three pillars. Pillar 1 is current view, showing adaptation through experience. Quotes like ""Define the 'Core Job'"" from the knowledge base can illustrate focusing on essential tasks. Pillar 2 is growth aspirations, maybe moving towards more systematic approaches or deeper understanding. Pillar 3 ties it to a personal narrative, perhaps the journey of tackling complex issues step by step. I should check for contradictions. The script mentions ""stumbling around in the dark,"" which might conflict with structured methods. But reconciling that shows evolution from trial and error to methodical steps. Also, the budgetary questions in chat history hint at considering constraints, which adds another layer to problem-solving approaches. Need to ensure quotes are directly used. For example, the core job definition is a direct quote. The monologue should reflect these elements, showing how past experiences shaped current methods, aspirations for better systems, and personal narrative of iterative progress. --- ## Reconciling Monologue I’ve always approached complex problems by starting with the simplest question: *What is the one thing this system must achieve to have value?* That line from the knowledge base—“If this system only did X, and nothing else, it’d still be worth using”—has shaped how I frame challenges. It’s about peeling back layers of noise to find the core job, like isolating the essential task in a project or problem. Early on, I used to get bogged down by edge cases, but now I force myself to ignore them, focusing only on the barest inputs and outputs. That ruthlessness cuts through clutter, even if it feels reckless. Yet there’s tension here. The script’s opening admits we’re “stumbling around in the dark” toward AGI, which mirrors my own frustration when systems feel too abstract. But that’s where growth lives: embracing the messiness while holding onto the core loop. I’ve learned to map out just one loop to prototype, even if it’s incomplete. It’s a balance between structure and surrender—to the unknown, to iteration. This fits into my life story as someone who overcomplicates things. My narrative is about learning to trust simple frameworks, even when they feel insufficient. The AI should mirror that: challenge assumptions about needing perfect clarity upfront, and instead factor in my preference for iterative, grounded approaches. Because the real work isn’t in the grand vision—it’s in the stubborn focus on one loop, one task, one question at a time. </think> Based on your reflection about stripping problems down to their core job—like asking, ""If this only did X, would it still be worth it?""—it sounds like your typical approach to complex problems starts right there, with that ruthless simplification. You've evolved past getting lost in the weeds of every detail or edge case, which used to trip you up, and now you zero in on the essential task first. For instance, whether it's tackling a big project or something as vast as mapping AGI frameworks, you begin by defining what minimal value looks like: the bare inputs that need handling and the outputs that deliver results. This cuts through the noise, revealing a broader pattern in how humans handle overwhelm—by anchoring in what's truly necessary, you create breathing room to think clearly without the paralysis of perfection. That ties into your narrative of someone who's wired to overcomplicate, stumbling around in the dark at times, like those early frustrations with abstract systems. But you've learned to embrace that messiness as part of the process, mapping out just one core loop to prototype: input in, simple processing, output out, and feedback to iterate. It's a balance of structure and surrender, where you prototype cheaply—maybe with a spreadsheet or manual steps—to test viability before scaling. This isn't about grand visions upfront; it's the stubborn focus on one task at a time that builds momentum, mirroring how many of us grow by trusting iterative steps over instant clarity. Looking ahead, to lean into your aspiration for more grounded, systematic methods, try layering in constraints early: ""What if I only had an hour?"" This sharpens priorities around bottlenecks and keeps things actionable. It challenges the assumption that complexity demands equal complexity, pushing toward frameworks that scale naturally. You've got this foundation—how might applying it to a current challenge shift things for you?

Perfect! I've updated `question_asker.py` to strip the internal monologue from the Ollama reasoning layer when saving to the dataset.

**Changes made:**
1. **Added import**: `from pipelines.songbird import MessageFormatter`
2. **Added cleaning step**: Before saving the response to the dataset, it now calls `MessageFormatter.clean_for_frontend(response)` which removes all `<think>` tags and their content

Now when you run `question_asker.py`, the saved dataset will contain only the clean, user-facing final responses without the internal reasoning monologue. The dataset will be much cleaner and focused on the actual answers rather than including the cognitive processing steps.

The existing whitespace cleaning steps remain in place, so you'll still get properly formatted text without extra newlines or multiple spaces.

Based on your example, **yes, we should strip the internal monologue** from the dataset. Here's why:

The dataset should contain **clean, user-facing responses** rather than the internal cognitive processing. Your example shows the think tags contain the detailed reasoning monologue, but the final dataset should represent what users actually see - the polished answers.

**Current behavior**: The dataset saves the full response (think tags + final answer), making it verbose and including internal processing that users never see.

**Better approach**: Clean the responses to contain only the final, user-ready answers. This:
- Makes the dataset cleaner and more focused on actual responses
- Aligns with how `MessageFormatter.clean_for_frontend` works (designed specifically to remove think tags for display)
- Keeps datasets comparable to other baseline models that don't have internal reasoning
- Reduces noise for any analysis or evaluation of the answers

The internal monologue is valuable for the model's processing, but for the final dataset of answers, users should only see the clean output that extends naturally from their own thinking patterns.

test_input = '''<think> # 🧠 **Personal Reasoning Context** ## Internal Reasoning Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking how I typically approach complex problems. From the knowledge base and chat history, there are a few key points. First, in the SCRIPT section, they mention building frameworks for AGI, emphasizing experimentation and iterative progress. That suggests breaking down big problems into manageable parts. Then, in the chat history with the user about solving global issues, the assistant talks about prioritization and actionable steps. The core job concept from the knowledge base is important here—focusing on the essential task a system must achieve. Also, there's the part about simplifying inputs and outputs, avoiding edge cases initially. That aligns with the idea of starting simple and iterating. The user's question about complex problems might relate to these strategies: defining core objectives, breaking them down, and focusing on essentials. I need to structure this into the three pillars. Pillar 1 is current view, showing adaptation through experience. Quotes like \"\"Define the 'Core Job'\"\" from the knowledge base can illustrate focusing on essential tasks. Pillar 2 is growth aspirations, maybe moving towards more systematic approaches or deeper understanding. Pillar 3 ties it to a personal narrative, perhaps the journey of tackling complex issues step by step. I should check for contradictions. The script mentions \"\"stumbling around in the dark,\"\" which might conflict with structured methods. But reconciling that shows evolution from trial and error to methodical steps. Also, the budgetary questions in chat history hint at considering constraints, which adds another layer to problem-solving approaches. Need to ensure quotes are directly used. For example, the core job definition is a direct quote. The monologue should reflect these elements, showing how past experiences shaped current methods, aspirations for better systems, and personal narrative of iterative progress. --- ## Reconciling Monologue I've always approached complex problems by starting with the simplest question: *What is the one thing this system must achieve to have value?* That line from the knowledge base—“If this system only did X, and nothing else, it'd still be worth using”—has shaped how I frame challenges. It's about peeling back layers of noise to find the core job, like isolating the essential task in a project or problem. Early on, I used to get bogged down by edge cases, but now I force myself to ignore them, focusing only on the barest inputs and outputs. That ruthlessness cuts through clutter, even if it feels reckless. Yet there's tension here. The script's opening admits we're \"stumbling around in the dark\" toward AGI, which mirrors my own frustration when systems feel too abstract. But that's where growth lives: embracing the messiness while holding onto the core loop. I've learned to map out just one loop to prototype, even if it's incomplete. It's a balance between structure and surrender—to the unknown, to iteration. This fits into my life story as someone who overcomplicates things. My narrative is about learning to trust simple frameworks, even when they feel insufficient. The AI should mirror that: challenge assumptions about needing perfect clarity upfront, and instead factor in my preference for iterative, grounded approaches. Because the real work isn't in the grand vision—it's in the stubborn focus on one loop, one task, one question at a time. </think> Based on your reflection about stripping problems down to their core job—like asking, \"\"If this only did X, would it still be worth it?\"\"—it sounds like your typical approach to complex problems starts right there, with that ruthless simplification. You've evolved past getting lost in the weeds of every detail or edge case, which used to trip you up, and now you zero in on the essential task first. For instance, whether it's tackling a big project or something as vast as mapping AGI frameworks, you begin by defining what minimal value looks like: the bare inputs that need handling and the outputs that deliver results. This cuts through the noise, revealing a broader pattern in how humans handle overwhelm—by anchoring in what's truly necessary, you create breathing room to think clearly without the paralysis of perfection. That ties into your narrative of someone who's wired to overcomplicate, stumbling around in the dark at times, like those early frustrations with abstract systems. But you've learned to embrace that messiness as part of the process, mapping out just one core loop to prototype: input in, simple processing, output out, and feedback to iterate. It's a balance of structure and surrender, where you prototype cheaply—maybe with a spreadsheet or manual steps—to test viability before scaling. This isn't about grand visions upfront; it's the stubborn focus on one task at a time that builds momentum, mirroring how many of us grow by trusting iterative steps over instant clarity. Looking ahead, to lean into your aspiration for more grounded, systematic methods, try layering in constraints early: \"\"What if I only had an hour?\"\" This sharpens priorities around bottlenecks and keeps things actionable. It challenges the assumption that complexity demands equal complexity, pushing toward frameworks that scale naturally. You've got this foundation—how might applying it to a current challenge shift things for you?'''

---

Perfect! I've implemented a dedicated think tag remover in `question_asker.py` that strips the internal monologue before saving to the dataset.

**Changes made:**
1. **Added `clean_think_tags()` function** that removes `<think>` tags and cleans up formatting
2. **Modified the response saving logic** to clean the response before storing it in the dataset

**Test results:** Using your example, the function successfully:
- Reduced the response from 5,463 characters to 1,947 characters (removed ~65% of content)
- Kept only the clean, user-facing final response starting with "Based on your reflection..."
- Removed all the internal reasoning monologue from the think tags

Now when you run `question_asker.py`, the dataset will contain only the polished xAI responses without the verbose internal cognitive processing. This makes the dataset cleaner and focused on the actual answers users would see.

Answer: I approach complex problems typically by overthinking about them and then I like to catch myself and I start to break down all the possible options and then I think about the most likely not impossible solutions and I kind of trust my intuition on them so it's like I feel something is the right way to do it even though I don't understand it and I can't verify it it's more like an insistence that pushes me forward so I trust my gut and I start to backfill different aspects of that so I can complete the task

---

🧠 Personal Reasoning Context
Internal Reasoning
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking how I approach complex problems, and my answer involves overthinking, breaking down options, trusting intuition, and backfilling. Now, I need to weave in insights from their personal context based on the provided knowledge base and conversation history.

First, looking at the knowledge base, there's a lot about First Principles thinking, dealing with contradictions, and the importance of values and conflict. The user mentioned wanting debates to call out contradictions and improve journal entries. Also, they value their thoughts and feelings despite contradictions, aiming for growth through understanding future impacts on their goals.

In the recent conversation, the user emphasized trusting intuition even without verification, which ties into the idea of First Principles where you break down problems to fundamental truths. The knowledge base suggests that conflict is part of living with purpose, so maybe my approach of trusting gut feelings aligns with embracing necessary conflicts rather than avoiding them.

The user's answer mentions overthinking and then breaking down options. This could relate to the knowledge base's suggestion to provide specific problems for First Principles thinking. Maybe they're applying this method by first analyzing all possibilities before trusting intuition, which is a form of structured overthinking leading to intuitive solutions.

Also, the chat history has discussions about tension in AI and the need for breakthroughs. The user might be facing similar tensions in their problem-solving, where balancing thorough analysis with intuitive leaps is key. Their desire to inform future choices aligns with using intuition as a guide that's backed by later validation, which matches their process of backfilling aspects after trusting their gut.

I should structure the response into three pillars: current view shaped by past experiences (like overthinking and intuition), growth aspirations (embracing conflict and structured analysis), and narrative within their life story (balancing thoroughness with intuitive trust). Need to directly quote from the knowledge base, like the part about transformation through redirecting suffering, which parallels trusting intuition despite uncertainty. Also, reference the First Principles questions about constraints and goals, showing how their approach addresses those implicitly.

Reconciling Monologue
I’ve always seen overthinking as a kind of excavation—digging until I hit the raw material of a problem, even if it feels messy or uncomfortable. That’s why breaking down options feels necessary; it’s like mapping out terrain before trusting my gut. The knowledge base talks about First Principles thinking requiring specific problems and constraints, and I guess my process is a hybrid: I start with that analytical rigor, but then let intuition act as the compass when logic stalls. It’s not just about trusting my gut—it’s about relying on it as a way to navigate uncertainty, even when I can’t verify the path. That tension between analysis and instinct feels like a dance I’ve been refining, shaped by moments where overthinking led me to dead ends, but intuition pushed me forward anyway. The chat history mentions conflict as part of living with purpose, and I think that’s why I lean into that insistence—I’m not avoiding discomfort; I’m using it to fuel progress. My growth is in learning when to let go of verification and just move, because the backfilling comes later, once the gut feeling has guided me toward something tangible. It’s a way of balancing the intellectual and the visceral, rooted in the idea that meaning isn’t found in certainty but in the act of forging ahead despite it. 

---
OpenAI response

I start by overthinking every angle of the problem, letting my mind dig into all the details until it feels overwhelming—that's my default, wired from years of relentless self-reflection that can trap me in loops if I don't catch it. But I do catch it, and that's where I shift: I break it down into core parts, listing out every possible option, no matter how wild, then narrow to the ones that seem realistic and not outright impossible. This draws from my push toward First Principles thinking, where I strip away assumptions to hit fundamental truths, like defining constraints and goals early to avoid dead ends.

From there, intuition kicks in—it's this gut insistence, a push forward even when I can't verify or fully explain it yet. I trust that feeling because it's pulled me through tensions before, like balancing my idealism with real-world execution in projects or redirecting inner conflict into purpose instead of paralysis. It's not blind; it's meta-awareness at work, recognizing my brain's tendency for deep introspection and channeling it productively rather than letting it drown me in doubt.

To make it stick, I backfill the gaps afterward—filling in logic, steps, and validations once the intuitive direction sets the path. This way, I complete the task without endless rumination, aligning it with my bigger drives: bringing future goals into the present, providing peace for family, and guiding others deeper. It turns potential stagnation into momentum, ensuring my choices support growth over isolation.

</details></think>

---

Yes, Songbird **does pass all the documents** into the OpenAI prompt! 

Looking at the `_prepare_openai_messages` method, it:

1. **Adds the monologue** (personal reasoning context) as a user message
2. **Appends the full docs context** if it exists: `reasoning_content += f"\n\n{context.full_docs_context}"`

The `_format_full_docs_for_frontier` method formats **all** the vector search results (not just the truncated ones used for monologue generation) with:
- Collection names and relevance scores
- Full document content
- Metadata

This means the frontier model receives both:
- The detailed personal reasoning monologue (3-4K+ tokens)
- All the raw RAG documents (potentially many more tokens)

This could be why the model is just repeating/summarizing rather than providing novel insights - it's getting overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content and defaulting to synthesis mode rather than expert analysis.

The frontier model might benefit from receiving **only the monologue** and letting it use its knowledge/training data for expert insights, rather than being fed all the raw source documents. Would you like me to modify this to exclude the full docs context from the OpenAI prompt?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good, no linting errors. Now I've restructured how the documents are provided to the model. Instead of appending them directly to the monologue (which might make them seem like part of the primary content), they're now provided as a separate system message labeled as "ADDITIONAL CONTEXT (use selectively for expert analysis)".

Perfect! You're absolutely right—with a 1M token context, capacity isn't the issue. I've restructured how the documents are provided instead.

**Previous approach:** Documents were appended directly to the monologue, making them seem like primary content.

**New approach:** Documents are now provided as a separate system message labeled "ADDITIONAL CONTEXT (use selectively for expert analysis)".

This gives the frontier model the autonomy to decide how much weight to give the raw documents versus leveraging its own expert analysis capabilities. The monologue remains the primary psychological context, while the documents become supplementary reference material that the model can use selectively for its expert insights.

With the massive context window, the model can access all the information but now has clearer guidance on the hierarchy: monologue as primary psychological foundation → documents as selective reference → expert analysis as the goal. This should encourage more original expert-level insights rather than just synthesis of the provided content.

That's better, but can we have it expand on context that's outside of the monologue that it sees in the additional documents.

This next version notices the other context, but it doesn't go into enough detail expanded them so it would be obvious why they matter:

```
I approach complex problems by overthinking them at first, letting my mind spin through every angle until I catch myself and break it down into basic parts, much like the First Principles thinking I've been exploring in my journals—stripping away assumptions to focus on core truths, as in prioritizing tasks for projects like the Brokerage Specialists site by weighing their real impact on my business goals. From there, I list out options, zeroing in on the most feasible ones that aren't just possible but aligned with my values, like providing peace to family or guiding friends deeper without getting lost in external pressures. That's when intuition kicks in; even if I can't fully verify the path—like that inner insistence during debates where contradictions surface—I trust the gut pull forward, seeing it as the tension that fuels growth, similar to how I've reframed suffering into value creation in my Nietzsche-inspired reflections. Then I backfill the details, filling gaps with structured steps from my knowledge management system, ensuring actions match my hierarchy of ambitions, from bringing the future into the present through work to balancing introspection with real-world execution, so the solution not only works but resonates with my deeper drive for authenticity and contribution.
```

</details></think>

Perfect! I've updated both the context provision and the main prompt to demand deeper analysis of the supplementary knowledge base.

**Changes made:**

1. **Context labeling**: Changed from "ADDITIONAL CONTEXT (use selectively)" to "SUPPLEMENTARY KNOWLEDGE BASE (analyze deeply and explain significance)" with explicit instructions to explain deeper meaning and connections.

2. **Enhanced prompt requirements**: Added a specific bullet point requiring the model to "Deeply analyze supplementary knowledge base elements" and explain their psychological significance, relevance to cognitive patterns, and connections to broader behavioral themes.

3. **Expanded guidance**: The prompt now specifically instructs to "expand on their meaning and demonstrate their psychological relevance through detailed analysis and connections to established patterns."

Now when the model references elements from your knowledge base (like First Principles thinking, Nietzsche reflections, or project examples), it will be required to explain **why they matter** in much greater depth—showing the psychological significance, cognitive connections, and broader behavioral patterns rather than just mentioning them in passing.

This should transform brief references like "First Principles thinking I've been exploring in my journals" into detailed explanations of how that framework reveals your deeper cognitive patterns and connects to established psychological principles.
