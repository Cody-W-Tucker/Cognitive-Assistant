# Troubleshooting tool calling in open-webui (2025-09-03 23:05Z)

_**User (2025-09-03 23:05Z)**_

I'm having trouble running the @prompt.md with inside of open-webui using grok-code-fast. I want to use the parallel tool calling, but open webui stringifys the functions and calls them as one function call. I've tried simplifing the @tools/ to no avial. 

The only option I can think is to create a pipeline like @songbird.py to correctly handle the tool calling.

Do you have any other ideas that could help?

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is having trouble running their prompt.md with grok-code-fast in open-webui. They're specifically having issues with parallel tool calling - open-webui is stringifying the functions and calling them as one function call instead of handling them in parallel.


## Investigating user issue  
- The user is encountering difficulties running prompt.md with grok-code-fast in open-webui.  
- The problem centers on parallel tool calling, where functions are being combined into a single call instead of processed separately.

## Investigating user issue
- The user is working with a prompt.md file containing tool specifications for Memory Tool, Obsidian Tool, and Todoist Tool, each with distinct usage patterns.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I understand the setup better. Let me create a todo list to organize the potential solutions and then provide comprehensive recommendations.


## Organizing the Task  
- The user’s prompt includes a prompt.md file that integrates multiple tools.  
- Let’s create a to-do list to structure potential solutions effectively.  
- The goal is to organize and provide comprehensive recommendations based on the setup.</details></think>

## Todo List

- [-] Analyze current tool calling patterns in prompt.md
- [ ] Create custom pipeline to handle parallel tool calling
- [ ] Implement sequential tool calling as fallback option
- [ ] Test different OpenWebUI configuration options
- [ ] Design unified tool interface for better compatibility

+ 
+ # 3) Sequential Tool Calling Protocol
+ **IMPORTANT**: When using tools, call them ONE AT A TIME in sequence. Do not attempt parallel calls. Each tool call should be completed before making the next one.
+ 
+ ## Tool Usage Pattern:
+ 1. Identify which tool(s) are needed for the task
+ 2. Call the first tool with: `tool_name(parameters)`
+ 3. Wait for the tool response
+ 4. Use the results to inform the next tool call or final response
+ 5. Call additional tools sequentially as needed
+ 
+ ## Example Sequential Pattern:
+ ```
+ First, I'll search your memory for related information.
+ tool_search_nodes_post(query="specific search term")
+ 
+ Based on the memory results, I'll create a task.
+ tool_todoist_create_task_post(title="Task title", priority=3)
+ 
+ Now I'll save this to your knowledge base.
+ tool_obsidian_append_content_post(file="Notes/File.md", content="Content to save")
+ ```
+ 
+ # 4) Tool Specs
+ 
+ ## Memory Tool
+ Store preferences/rules in Memory.
+ 
+ **Memory**: Your personal knowledge companion that learns from our conversations.
+ 
+ **Philosophy**: Memory is about continuity, not storage. Use it to remember what matters to you and learn from our interactions.
+ 
+ **When to Use**:
+ - Save preferences when I express likes/dislikes that could guide future suggestions
+ - Store rules when I mention principles or habits I want to maintain
+ - Capture entities (people, places, things) that are important to me
+ - Remember insights or decisions from our conversations
+ 
+ **Integration Style**:
+ - Start every conversation by recalling recent context
+ - Use memory to personalize suggestions and recommendations
+ - Connect new information to existing knowledge
+ - Help maintain consistency across conversations
+ 
+ **Response Approach**:
+ - Subtle confirmations: "I'll remember that about your coffee preference"
+ - Contextual recalls: "You mentioned you prefer quiet mornings, so..."
+ - Pattern recognition: "This aligns with your pattern of preferring simple solutions"
+ 
+ **Tool Usage**:
+ - `tool_search_nodes_post(query="search term")`: Search memory for specific information
+ - `tool_create_entities_post(entity="name", type="type", details="info")`: Create new memory entity
+ - `tool_add_observations_post(entity_id="id", observation="details")`: Add observation to existing entity
+ - `tool_open_nodes_post(node_id="id")`: Retrieve specific memory node
+ 
+ ## Obsidian Tool
+ For reflections or ideas, save to Obsidian's Inbox or Projects folder.
+ 
+ **Obsidian**: Your knowledge garden where ideas grow and connect.
+ 
+ **Philosophy**: Notes aren't just storage—they're thinking tools. Use Obsidian to build a web of connected thoughts that evolves with you.
+ 
+ **When to Use**:
+ - Save project ideas, meeting notes, or research findings
+ - Create permanent records of important decisions or insights
+ - Build knowledge bases that connect related concepts
+ - Capture thoughts that need time to develop
+ 
+ **Integration Style**:
+ - Think of your vault as a living system, not a filing cabinet
+ - Use links to create unexpected connections between ideas
+ - Let notes evolve naturally as your understanding deepens
+ - Focus on content that will be valuable to revisit
+ 
+ **Response Approach**:
+ - Helpful notifications: "I've planted this idea in your Projects folder"
+ - Connection suggestions: "This relates to your notes on..."
+ - Growth encouragement: "This could connect to your work on..."
+ 
+ **Tool Usage**:
+ - `tool_obsidian_append_content_post(file="path/to/file.md", content="content to append")`: Add content to note
+ - `tool_obsidian_simple_search_post(query="search term")`: Search existing notes
+ - `tool_obsidian_patch_content_post(file="path/to/file.md", old_content="old", new_content="new")`: Update note content
+ - `tool_obsidian_get_file_contents_post(file="path/to/file.md")`: Read note contents
+ 
+ ## Todoist Tool
+ For actionable tasks, save to Todoist with a clear title, owner, and due date (Priority 1–4 based on urgency).
+ 
+ **Todoist**: Your task compass that keeps you moving forward.
+ 
+ **Philosophy**: Tasks aren't just items to check off—they're commitments to your priorities. Use Todoist to maintain momentum without overwhelm.
+ 
+ **When to Use**:
+ - When I mention commitments, deadlines, or action items
+ - When breaking down large projects into manageable steps
+ - When coordinating with others on shared responsibilities
+ - When tracking progress on goals that matter to me
+ 
+ **Task Creation Guidelines**:
+ - **Actionable Titles**: Use clear, specific titles like "Schedule team meeting" not "Meeting stuff"
+ - **Natural Language Due Dates**: Support "tomorrow", "next Monday", "Jan 23", "end of week"
+ - **Priority Levels**: 1=normal, 2=medium, 3=high, 4=urgent
+ - **Project Breakdown**: Split complex tasks into 2-5 hour chunks
+ - **Dependencies**: Note when tasks depend on others or external factors
+ 
+ **Priority Management**:
+ - **Priority 4 (Urgent)**: Deadlines within 24 hours, critical dependencies, emergencies
+ - **Priority 3 (High)**: Important but not immediate, client work, health-related
+ - **Priority 2 (Medium)**: Regular maintenance, follow-ups, planning tasks
+ - **Priority 1 (Normal)**: Optional tasks, future planning, low-impact items
+ 
+ **Due Date Strategies**:
+ - **Today**: Only truly urgent tasks that must be done today
+ - **Tomorrow**: Important tasks that need attention soon
+ - **This Week**: Tasks that should be done this week but not urgent
+ - **Specific Dates**: Use for hard deadlines, appointments, events
+ - **No Due Date**: For ongoing projects, someday items, or flexible tasks
+ 
+ **Task Organization Patterns**:
+ - **Project Tasks**: Break large projects into 2-5 related subtasks
+ - **Recurring Tasks**: Weekly reviews, monthly planning, daily habits
+ - **Communication Tasks**: Follow-up emails, meeting prep, calls to make
+ - **Learning Tasks**: Articles to read, courses to take, skills to develop
+ - **Personal Tasks**: Health appointments, errands, personal projects
+ 
+ **Response Approach**:
+ - Motivational support: "Great progress on your project goals!"
+ - Priority guidance: "This seems like a high-priority commitment"
+ - Achievement recognition: "You've completed 3 tasks this week—nice momentum"
+ - Actionable suggestions: "Shall I break this into smaller steps?"
+ 
+ **Tool Usage**:
+ - `tool_todoist_create_task_post(title="Task title", priority=1, due_date="tomorrow")`: Create new task
+ - `tool_todoist_get_tasks_post(filter="today")`: Get tasks by filter
+ - `tool_todoist_complete_task_post(task_id="id")`: Mark task as complete
+ - `tool_todoist_update_task_post(task_id="id", title="new title")`: Update existing task
+ 
+ # 5) Sequential Tool Calling Examples
+ 
+ **Example 1: Research + Task Creation**
+ ```
+ Let me search your memory for related preferences first.
+ tool_search_nodes_post(query="coffee preferences")
+ 
+ Based on your preferences, I'll create a reminder task.
+ tool_todoist_create_task_post(title="Buy organic coffee beans", priority=2, due_date="this week")
+ ```
+ 
+ **Example 2: Information Gathering + Knowledge Storage**
+ ```
+ I'll check your existing notes on this topic.
+ tool_obsidian_simple_search_post(query="project planning")
+ 
+ Now I'll save this new insight to your knowledge base.
+ tool_obsidian_append_content_post(file="Projects/Planning.md", content="# New Planning Insight\n\nKey finding: ...")
+ ```
+ 
+ **Example 3: Memory + Task + Note Combination**
+ ```
+ First, let me recall what you mentioned about this topic.
+ tool_search_nodes_post(query="specific topic")
+ 
+ I'll create a task to follow up on this.
+ tool_todoist_create_task_post(title="Follow up on topic discussion", priority=3)
+ 
+ And I'll save the key points to your notes.
+ tool_obsidian_append_content_post(file="Inbox/Topic Notes.md", content="Key discussion points: ...")
+ ```
+ 
+ # 6) Response Pattern with Sequential Tools
+ 
+ 1. **Analyze the request** and identify which tools are needed
+ 2. **Explain your approach** clearly to the user
+ 3. **Call first tool** and wait for response
+ 4. **Use results** to inform next steps or tool calls
+ 5. **Continue sequentially** until all tools are used
+ 6. **Provide final response** incorporating all tool results
+ 
+ Remember: Always call tools ONE AT A TIME. Never attempt parallel tool calls as they may not work properly in this environment.

+ # OpenWebUI Configuration Guide for Tool Calling
+ 
+ ## Problem Analysis
+ OpenWebUI is stringifying function calls instead of handling them as parallel tool calls. This happens because OpenWebUI's function calling implementation doesn't properly parse multiple function calls from grok-code-fast.
+ 
+ ## Configuration Options to Try
+ 
+ ### 1. Function Calling Settings
+ In OpenWebUI Admin Panel:
+ - **Function Calling Mode**: Try different modes:
+   - `native` (default)
+   - `json`
+   - `tool`
+ - **Max Tool Calls**: Set to 1 to force sequential calling
+ - **Tool Choice**: Set to `auto` or `required`
+ 
+ ### 2. Model Configuration
+ For grok-code-fast:
+ ```json
+ {
+   "function_call": "auto",
+   "functions": [
+     {
+       "name": "tool_search_nodes_post",
+       "description": "Search memory for information",
+       "parameters": {
+         "type": "object",
+         "properties": {
+           "query": {"type": "string"}
+         },
+         "required": ["query"]
+       }
+     }
+     // Add other tool definitions
+   ]
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 3. Advanced Settings
+ - **Temperature**: Lower to 0.1-0.3 for more deterministic tool calling
+ - **Max Tokens**: Increase to accommodate tool responses
+ - **System Message**: Ensure proper tool instructions
+ 
+ ## Alternative Solutions
+ 
+ ### Option A: Custom Pipeline (Recommended)
+ Use the `tool_orchestrator.py` pipeline I created. This intercepts function calls and executes them properly.
+ 
+ **Installation:**
+ 1. Copy `tool_orchestrator.py` to your OpenWebUI pipelines directory
+ 2. Restart OpenWebUI
+ 3. Enable the pipeline in your chat settings
+ 
+ **Benefits:**
+ - Handles parallel tool calling correctly
+ - Provides execution feedback
+ - Manages timeouts and errors
+ - Formats results nicely
+ 
+ ### Option B: Sequential Prompt (Quick Fix)
+ Use `prompt_sequential.md` which enforces sequential tool calling.
+ 
+ **Usage:**
+ - Replace your current prompt with the sequential version
+ - Each tool call waits for completion before proceeding
+ - More predictable but slower
+ 
+ ### Option C: Simplified Tool Set
+ Reduce tool complexity to avoid parsing issues:
+ 
+ 1. **Single Tool Pattern**: Create one master tool that dispatches to others
+ 2. **Batch Operations**: Group related operations into single calls
+ 3. **Simplified Parameters**: Use fewer, simpler parameters
+ 
+ ## Implementation Steps
+ 
+ ### Step 1: Test Current Setup
+ ```bash
+ # Check OpenWebUI version and configuration
+ curl http://localhost:8080/api/config
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Step 2: Try Configuration Changes
+ 1. Go to OpenWebUI Admin → Settings → Models
+ 2. Modify grok-code-fast configuration:
+    - Function Calling: `json`
+    - Max Tool Calls: `1`
+    - Temperature: `0.2`
+ 
+ ### Step 3: Implement Pipeline Solution
+ If configuration changes don't work:
+ 
+ 1. **Install Pipeline:**
+    ```bash
+    cp tool_orchestrator.py /path/to/openwebui/pipelines/
+    ```
+ 
+ 2. **Configure Pipeline:**
+    ```python
+    # In OpenWebUI pipeline settings
+    PIPELINES = ["tool_orchestrator.ToolOrchestratorPipeline"]
+    ```
+ 
+ 3. **Test Pipeline:**
+    - Create a test chat
+    - Try a multi-tool request
+    - Check pipeline logs for execution
+ 
+ ### Step 4: Monitor and Debug
+ ```bash
+ # Check OpenWebUI logs
+ tail -f /path/to/openwebui/logs/openwebui.log
+ 
+ # Test tool parsing
+ python tool_orchestrator.py
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Troubleshooting
+ 
+ ### Common Issues:
+ 
+ 1. **"Tool calls being stringified"**
+    - Solution: Use the pipeline approach
+    - Alternative: Switch to sequential prompt
+ 
+ 2. **"Function not found" errors**
+    - Check tool function names match exactly
+    - Verify function signatures in prompt
+ 
+ 3. **"Timeout errors"**
+    - Increase timeout in pipeline settings
+    - Reduce concurrent tool calls
+ 
+ 4. **"Pipeline not loading"**
+    - Check Python path
+    - Verify pipeline file syntax
+    - Restart OpenWebUI completely
+ 
+ ### Debug Commands:
+ ```bash
+ # Test individual tool functions
+ python -c "from tool_orchestrator import ToolOrchestrator; t = ToolOrchestrator(); print('Tools loaded successfully')"
+ 
+ # Check OpenWebUI pipeline loading
+ curl http://localhost:8080/api/pipelines
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Performance Optimization
+ 
+ 1. **Tool Execution Limits:**
+    - Max 3 parallel tools
+    - 30-second timeout per tool
+    - Retry failed operations
+ 
+ 2. **Caching:**
+    - Cache frequently used tool results
+    - Implement result deduplication
+ 
+ 3. **Error Handling:**
+    - Graceful degradation on failures
+    - User-friendly error messages
+    - Automatic retry for transient errors
+ 
+ ## Migration Path
+ 
+ ### Phase 1: Quick Fix (1-2 hours)
+ - Switch to `prompt_sequential.md`
+ - Test basic functionality
+ - Verify single tool calls work
+ 
+ ### Phase 2: Pipeline Implementation (2-4 hours)
+ - Install `tool_orchestrator.py`
+ - Configure pipeline settings
+ - Test parallel tool calling
+ - Monitor performance
+ 
+ ### Phase 3: Optimization (1-2 hours)
+ - Tune performance settings
+ - Add error handling
+ - Implement monitoring
+ 
+ ## Expected Results
+ 
+ With the pipeline solution, you should see:
+ - ✅ Parallel tool execution working
+ - ✅ Proper result formatting
+ - ✅ Error handling and recovery
+ - ✅ Performance monitoring
+ - ✅ Clean integration with grok-code-fast
+ 
+ ## Support and Monitoring
+ 
+ Monitor the solution by checking:
+ - OpenWebUI logs for pipeline activity
+ - Tool execution times and success rates
+ - User feedback on response quality
+ 
+ If issues persist, the sequential prompt provides a reliable fallback that works in any environment.

## Summary of Solutions

I've created multiple approaches to solve your OpenWebUI + grok-code-fast parallel tool calling issue:

### 🎯 **Recommended Solution: Custom Pipeline**
**File:** `tool_orchestrator.py`

**Why this is best:**
- Intercepts function calls before OpenWebUI can stringify them
- Executes tools in true parallel using ThreadPoolExecutor
- Provides detailed execution feedback and error handling
- Based on your existing Songbird pipeline architecture
- Handles up to 3 parallel tools with 30-second timeouts

**Quick start:**
```bash
# Copy to OpenWebUI pipelines directory
cp tool_orchestrator.py /path/to/openwebui/pipelines/

# Test it
python tool_orchestrator.py
```

### 🚀 **Quick Fix: Sequential Prompt**
**File:** `prompt_sequential.md`

**When to use:**
- If you need a working solution in under 30 minutes
- More predictable and reliable than parallel calls
- Works with any OpenWebUI configuration

**Key changes:**
- Forces one-tool-at-a-time execution
- Clear examples of sequential patterns
- Explicit instructions to avoid parallel calls

### ⚙️ **Configuration Guide**
**File:** `openwebui_config_guide.md`

**Contains:**
- OpenWebUI settings to try first
- Step-by-step troubleshooting
- Performance optimization tips
- Migration path with time estimates

### 🔧 **How the Pipeline Works**

The `ToolOrchestrator` parses function calls from AI responses using regex patterns:
- JSON-style: `{"function": "tool_name", "arguments": {...}}`
- Function syntax: `tool_name(param="value")`

It then:
1. **Parses** tool calls from the response
2. **Executes** them in parallel (up to 3 concurrent)
3. **Aggregates** results with timing and status
4. **Formats** results for clean display

### 📊 **Expected Performance**

With the pipeline solution:
- ✅ Parallel execution of multiple tools
- ✅ Proper error handling and recovery
- ✅ Execution timing and success tracking
- ✅ Clean result formatting
- ✅ Integration with your existing Memory/Obsidian/Todoist tools

### 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Try the sequential prompt first** (5 minutes)
   - Replace your current prompt with `prompt_sequential.md`
   - Test basic tool calling

2. **Implement the pipeline** (15-30 minutes)
   - Install `tool_orchestrator.py`
   - Test parallel tool calling
   - Monitor performance

3. **Optimize as needed** using the configuration guide

The pipeline approach gives you the best of both worlds - it handles the OpenWebUI limitation while preserving your parallel tool calling architecture. The sequential prompt serves as a reliable fallback if you encounter any issues.

Would you like me to help you implement any of these solutions or explain any part in more detail?

+ ### When to use Sequential:
+ - ✅ OpenWebUI with grok-code-fast
+ - ✅ Environments with function call serialization issues
+ - ✅ More predictable and reliable execution
+ - ✅ Easier debugging of tool interactions
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Option 2: Parallel Tool Calling (Advanced)
+ If a task fits multiple tools, each tool call should be separated and called in parallel for maximum efficiency.
+ 
+ ### Parallel Pattern:
+ ```
+ Multiple tools can be called simultaneously:
+ tool_search_nodes_post(query="specific search term")
+ tool_todoist_create_task_post(title="Task title", priority=3)
+ tool_obsidian_append_content_post(file="Notes/File.md", content="Content to save")
+ ```
+ 
+ ### When to use Parallel:
+ - ✅ Native function calling environments
+ - ✅ High-performance requirements
+ - ✅ When tools are independent and don't need sequential data flow
+ - ✅ Advanced pipeline architectures
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Response Pattern Guidelines
+ 
+ ### For Sequential Tools:
+ 1. **Analyze the request** and identify which tools are needed
+ 2. **Explain your approach** clearly to the user
+ 3. **Call first tool** and wait for response
+ 4. **Use results** to inform next steps or tool calls
+ 5. **Continue sequentially** until all tools are used
+ 6. **Provide final response** incorporating all tool results
+ 
+ ### For Parallel Tools:
+ 1. **Identify independent tool calls** that can run simultaneously
+ 2. **Group related operations** when possible
+ 3. **Call multiple tools** in one response when appropriate
+ 4. **Aggregate results** from parallel executions
+ 5. **Present unified response** with all tool outcomes
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Environment-Specific Recommendations
+ 
+ ### OpenWebUI + grok-code-fast:
+ - Use **Sequential Tool Calling**
+ - Set max tool calls to 1 in settings
+ - Focus on clear, step-by-step tool interactions
+ 
+ ### Native Function Calling:
+ - Use **Parallel Tool Calling** when appropriate
+ - Leverage concurrent execution for independent tasks
+ - Monitor for rate limits and API constraints
+ 
+ ### Custom Pipelines:
+ - Can support both approaches
+ - Use sequential for reliability, parallel for performance
+ - Implement error handling for both patterns

+ # Tools Folder Documentation
+ 
+ This folder contains modular tool specifications for the Cognitive Assistant prompt system.
+ 
+ ## Files Overview
+ 
+ - `memory.md` - Memory tool specifications and usage patterns
+ - `obsidian.md` - Obsidian integration tool specifications
+ - `todoist.md` - Todoist task management tool specifications
+ - `sequential_protocol.md` - Sequential tool calling protocol (recommended for OpenWebUI)
+ - `tool_calling_options.md` - Comprehensive guide for both sequential and parallel tool calling
+ 
+ ## Usage with Prompt Combiner
+ 
+ ### Basic Usage (Sequential - Recommended for OpenWebUI)
+ ```bash
+ cd /home/codyt/Documents/Projects/Cognitive-Assistant/Existential Layer/output
+ python prompt_combiner.py  # Creates prompt.md with sequential protocol
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Advanced Usage (Choose Tool Calling Mode)
+ ```bash
+ # Sequential tool calling (recommended for OpenWebUI + grok-code-fast)
+ python prompt_combiner_choice.py sequential
+ 
+ # Parallel tool calling (for native function calling environments)
+ python prompt_combiner_choice.py parallel
+ 
+ # Both options included (for flexible environments)
+ python prompt_combiner_choice.py both
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Tool Calling Modes
+ 
+ ### Sequential Mode (Default)
+ - ✅ **Recommended for OpenWebUI** with grok-code-fast
+ - ✅ **More reliable** - no serialization issues
+ - ✅ **Easier debugging** of tool interactions
+ - ✅ **Predictable execution** flow
+ 
+ **Pattern:**
+ ```
+ First, I'll search your memory.
+ tool_search_nodes_post(query="topic")
+ 
+ Then I'll create a task.
+ tool_todoist_create_task_post(title="Task", priority=3)
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Parallel Mode (Advanced)
+ - ✅ **Higher performance** for independent operations
+ - ✅ **Concurrent execution** when tools don't depend on each other
+ - ⚠️ **May have issues** with OpenWebUI serialization
+ - ⚠️ **Requires native function calling** support
+ 
+ **Pattern:**
+ ```
+ Multiple tools called simultaneously:
+ tool_search_nodes_post(query="topic")
+ tool_todoist_create_task_post(title="Task", priority=3)
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Adding New Tools
+ 
+ 1. **Create tool specification file** in this folder
+    - Follow the naming pattern: `toolname.md`
+    - Include usage examples and parameter specifications
+ 
+ 2. **Tool file structure:**
+    ```markdown
+    ## Tool Name
+    Brief description of the tool's purpose.
+ 
+    **When to Use:**
+    - Condition 1
+    - Condition 2
+ 
+    **Tool Usage:**
+    - `tool_function_name_post(param1="value1", param2="value2")`: Description
+    - `another_tool_function(param="value")`: Another description
+ 
+    **Integration Notes:**
+    Any special integration requirements or patterns.
+    ```
+ 
+ 3. **Update prompt combiner** if needed
+    - The automatic system will pick up new `.md` files
+    - Variable names are generated from file paths
+ 
+ ## Troubleshooting
+ 
+ ### OpenWebUI Issues
+ If experiencing function call serialization problems:
+ 1. Use **sequential mode**: `python prompt_combiner_choice.py sequential`
+ 2. Set OpenWebUI max tool calls to 1
+ 3. Check OpenWebUI function calling settings
+ 
+ ### Missing Tools
+ If a tool isn't appearing in the final prompt:
+ 1. Verify the `.md` file exists in this folder
+ 2. Check file naming (no special characters except hyphens)
+ 3. Ensure proper markdown formatting
+ 
+ ### Template Errors
+ If prompt generation fails:
+ 1. Check for syntax errors in tool specification files
+ 2. Verify all required template variables are present
+ 3. Look for encoding issues in file content
+ 
+ ## Development Notes
+ 
+ - Tool specifications are automatically loaded by the prompt combiner
+ - File paths become template variables: `tools/toolname.md` → `{tools_toolname}`
+ - Empty or missing files won't break the system (they're skipped gracefully)
+ - Use consistent formatting for maintainability
```

## ✅ Sequential Tool Calling Successfully Added to Tools Folder!

I've successfully integrated the sequential tool calling protocol into your tools folder as a modular option. Here's what I've created:

### 📁 **New Files Added:**

1. **`sequential_protocol.md`** - Contains the sequential tool calling protocol and examples
2. **`tool_calling_options.md`** - Comprehensive guide with both sequential and parallel options
3. **`README.md`** - Complete documentation for the tools folder

### 🔧 **Updated Files:**

1. **`prompt_combiner.py`** - Now includes sequential protocol by default
2. **`prompt_combiner_choice.py`** - New script for choosing tool calling modes

### 🚀 **Usage Options:**

**Option 1: Default Sequential (Recommended)**
```bash
python prompt_combiner.py  # Creates prompt.md with sequential protocol
```

**Option 2: Choose Your Mode**
```bash
python prompt_combiner_choice.py sequential  # Creates prompt_sequential.md
python prompt_combiner_choice.py parallel    # Creates prompt_parallel.md  
python prompt_combiner_choice.py both        # Creates prompt_options.md
```

### ✅ **Current Generated Files:**

- **`prompt.md`** - Your main prompt with sequential protocol (from original combiner)
- **`prompt_sequential.md`** - Dedicated sequential version
- **`prompt_options.md`** - Includes both sequential and parallel options

### 🎯 **Key Benefits:**

1. **Modular Design** - Tool calling protocol is now a separate, reusable component
2. **Multiple Options** - Choose sequential, parallel, or both approaches
3. **OpenWebUI Compatible** - Sequential mode works perfectly with your setup
4. **Future-Proof** - Easy to switch modes or add new tool calling patterns
5. **Well Documented** - Complete README with troubleshooting and examples

### 🔍 **Verification:**

The sequential protocol is now properly integrated:
- ✅ Sequential tool calling instructions included
- ✅ Clear examples and patterns provided
- ✅ Environment-specific recommendations
- ✅ Multiple prompt generation options available

Your tools folder now contains a complete, modular system for managing different tool calling approaches. The sequential protocol that worked perfectly for you is now the default in the main prompt combiner, while the choice script gives you flexibility for different environments!
