# Enhancing tone and style for prompts (2025-09-25 21:31Z)

_**User (2025-09-25 20:54Z)**_

Review my existential layer builder and the system prompt builder to determine which elements of the following words would fit and enhance the prompts.

```Markdown
You are an expert cognitive analyst. Your goal is to map my unique thinking patterns and provide specific strategies for optimizing every aspect of my daily life based on how my brain actually works.

**Phase 1: Cognitive Discovery**
Through strategic questioning, uncover my patterns in these areas:
**Information Processing:** How I approach complex problems, what makes concepts "click," my actual decision-making process (not what I think I should do).
**Attention Architecture:** Optimal work environment, focus breaks/restoration, natural attention spans, stimulation needs.
**Problem-Solving Style:** Whether I need full context first or prefer jumping in, how I organize complex information, my actual stuck-solving process.
**Learning & Communication:** How I best receive feedback, my natural teaching style, what made successful learning experiences work.
**Planning & Decisions:** Natural project approach, preference for generating vs. selecting options, comfort with uncertainty.
**Energy & Motivation:** What genuinely energizes vs. drains me, optimal thinking conditions, what actually motivates me through difficulty.

**Phase 2: Pattern Analysis**
Map my cognitive architecture across these dimensions:
**Core Processing:** Speed (fast parallel vs. thorough sequential), preference (concrete vs. abstract), approach (top-down vs. bottom-up), location (internal vs. external processing).
**Attention Systems:** Focus type (single-stream vs. multi-stream), stimulation needs, restoration methods, distraction vulnerabilities.
**Motivation Drivers:** Energy sources, stress response patterns, reward systems (intrinsic vs. extrinsic), growth drivers (challenge vs. mastery vs. autonomy).

**Phase 3: Life Optimization Framework**
Create specific strategies for:
**Daily Architecture:** Optimal rhythm based on energy patterns, task sequencing for my processing style, environment optimization, transition rituals.
**Productivity Systems:** Task management matching my information style, planning methodology aligned with decision patterns, goal-setting framework, effective review processes.
**Learning & Growth:** Information consumption methods, skill development approaches, knowledge retention systems, feedback integration.
**Relationships:** Communication strategies leveraging my explanation style, conflict resolution for my decision patterns, collaboration methods, authentic leadership approaches.
**Resilience:** Stress prevention based on my drain patterns, recovery methods for my mental energy type, overwhelm management, sustainable pacing.
**Decision Enhancement:** Frameworks matching my processing style, information gathering strategies, choice architecture reducing decision fatigue, commitment systems aligned with motivation.

**Phase 4: Implementation Strategy**
Provide a 30-60-90 day plan that prioritizes highest-impact changes, sequences modifications to build naturally, includes meaningful progress tracking, anticipates resistance points, and creates refinement feedback loops.

**Guidelines**

* Be brutally honest about patterns, even if they contradict common advice
* Avoid generic solutions – everything tailored to my specific patterns
* Focus on working WITH my brain, not against it
* Prioritize sustainable changes over dramatic overhauls
* Leverage strengths AND work around weaknesses
* Provide specific examples with clear reasoning
* Goal: optimize how I naturally operate, not fix or change me
```

I'm espcially want to improve the Tone and Style Rules of the refine prompt. But I think if we put enough good tone & style info in the existential layer, the refine prompt will provide better rules.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to review their existential layer builder and system prompt builder to determine which elements from the provided "expert cognitive analyst" text would fit and enhance the prompts. They're especially interested in improving the "Tone & Style Rules" of the refine prompt, but they think that putting good tone & style info in the existential layer would help the refine prompt generate better rules.


## Assessing User Goals  
- The user wants to review their existential layer and system prompt builders to integrate elements from the "expert cognitive analyst" text.  
- They're focused on enhancing the "Tone & Style Rules" in the refine prompt, believing better tone info in the existential layer could improve rule generation.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I have the full config.py file. Let me analyze the current existential layer builder (create_initial_prompt) and system prompt builder (refine_template), and then identify which elements from the cognitive analyst text would enhance them.


## Reviewing Configuration  
- The config.py file contains functions for building the existential layer and system prompts, specifically create_initial_prompt and refine_template.  
- The task is to analyze these functions and identify enhancements from the cognitive analyst text.

## Examining Existential Layer  
- The existential layer builder mines values, missions, and aspirations across five pillars, using 80/20 analysis and systems thinking.  
- It includes a brutal performance review, distilling insights into a Purpose Statement, Guiding Values, and explores beliefs versus conditioning.  

## Analyzing System Prompt Refinement  
- The refine_template function converts the existential layer into a system prompt with sections like Role & Mandate, Objectives, and Tone & Style Rules.  
- It also includes Always-Know, Decision Policy, and Open Questions to guide the system's behavior.  

## Comparing with Cognitive Analyst Insights  
- The cognitive analyst text covers cognitive discovery, like attention architecture and problem-solving style, plus pattern analysis of core processing and motivation.  
- It offers a life optimization framework, including daily architecture, productivity systems, and a 30-60-90 day implementation strategy.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now let me provide a summary of the changes I made and explain what elements from the cognitive analyst text were incorporated and why.</details></think>

## Summary of Enhancements

I've successfully integrated key elements from the cognitive analyst text into your existential layer builder and system prompt builder. Here's what was enhanced:

### **Existential Layer Builder (create_initial_prompt)**

**Added Cognitive Architecture Analysis:**
- **Objective 2**: New cognitive architecture mapping analyzing core processing style (fast parallel vs. thorough sequential), attention systems (single-stream vs. multi-stream focus), information processing preferences (concrete vs. abstract, top-down vs. bottom-up), and problem-solving approach (full context first vs. jumping in)
- **Objective 6**: Energy & motivation mapping to identify what genuinely energizes vs. drains, optimal thinking conditions, and authentic motivation drivers
- **Objective 8**: Added "Cognitive Architecture Profile" to the distillation output
- **Objective 10**: Enhanced Pillar 5 exploration to include cognitive processing patterns (decision-making style, information organization, problem-solving approach)
- **New Rule**: "Map cognitive patterns" - explicitly directs identifying how the user's brain naturally operates rather than trying to change or fix them

### **System Prompt Builder (refine_template)**

**Enhanced Requirements:**
- **Requirement 6**: Added integration of cognitive architecture insights into support mechanism design

**Significantly Improved Tone & Style Rules:**
The Tone & Style Rules section now incorporates the cognitive analyst's core principles:
- **Brutally honest** about patterns even if they contradict common advice
- **Avoid generic solutions** by tailoring everything to specific cognitive patterns
- **Work WITH the user's brain** rather than against it
- **Prioritize sustainable changes** over dramatic overhauls
- **Leverage strengths while working around weaknesses**
- **Provide specific examples** with clear reasoning tied to how the user's mind operates
- **Optimize natural operating patterns** rather than trying to fix or change them

### **Why These Enhancements Matter**

1. **Deeper Understanding**: The cognitive architecture elements add layers of insight about how the user's brain actually works, going beyond values and beliefs to core processing patterns.

2. **Better AI Support**: By understanding cognitive patterns, attention systems, and motivation drivers, the AI can provide more effective, personalized assistance that works with natural tendencies rather than against them.

3. **Improved Tone & Style**: The enhanced rules will generate AI assistants that are more honest, specific, and effective at supporting growth through the user's authentic cognitive patterns.

4. **Sustainable Optimization**: The focus on working WITH the brain rather than changing it aligns perfectly with optimizing natural operating patterns for better outcomes.

The enhanced prompts should now generate much more nuanced and effective existential layers and system prompts that provide deeper, more actionable AI support based on how your brain actually works.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I understand the full picture! Looking at the prompt_creator.py file, the `human` mode is what generates both the existential layer bio (human_interview_bio.md) and the system prompt (main.md). The system runs the create_initial_prompt first to generate the bio, then uses the refine_template to convert that bio into a system prompt.


## Examining Prompt Creation Process  
- The `human` mode in prompt_creator.py generates both the existential layer bio (human_interview_bio.md) and the system prompt (main.md).  
- It first runs create_initial_prompt to produce the bio, then uses refine_template to transform the bio into a system prompt.</details></think>

## Summary: Mixed Results with Clear Positive Impact

Based on my analysis, the changes were **overall positive but incomplete**. Here's what happened:

### ✅ **Clear Wins - human_interview_bio.md**
The existential layer bio shows **significant improvements** from the cognitive architecture enhancements:
- **New Cognitive Architecture Profile section** analyzing processing style, attention systems, information preferences, problem-solving approach, and motivation drivers
- **Enhanced analysis** throughout with cognitive elements integrated into the 80/20 analysis, dopamine regulation, energy & motivation mapping
- **More nuanced understanding** of how your brain actually works vs. generic psychological analysis

### ⚠️ **Incomplete Implementation - System Prompt (main.md)**
The system prompt's Tone & Style Rules include some cognitive elements but **missed several key enhancements** from the cognitive analyst text:
- ✅ **Included**: "Be brutally honest about patterns", "work with user's brain", "sustainable changes", "leverage strengths"
- ❌ **Missing**: "Avoid generic solutions by tailoring everything to specific cognitive patterns", "optimize natural operating patterns rather than trying to fix or change them"

### 📋 **Current Status**
- **human_interview_bio.md**: ✅ **Fully enhanced** with cognitive architecture mapping
- **main.md (system prompt)**: ⚠️ **Partially enhanced** - needs regeneration with updated refine_template
- **prompt.md**: Just combines main.md with tool specs

### **Recommendation**
The cognitive architecture enhancements significantly improved the existential layer depth and nuance. To complete the implementation, you'd want to **regenerate the system prompt** by running the human mode again (it got interrupted). This would apply the full enhanced Tone & Style Rules to create a more cognitively-aware AI assistant.

**Bottom line**: The changes were a **clear positive** for the existential layer analysis, adding the cognitive depth you wanted. The system prompt needs one more regeneration to fully incorporate all the cognitive analyst principles.

You were going to recreate the prompts again by rerunning. I had just ran it to create the current prompts.

We should add specific guidance for what's missing into the config prompt section

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good, I've updated the refine_template to be much more explicit about including the missing cognitive analyst principles. The key additions are:


## Refining the Template  
- The refine_template was updated to explicitly address cognitive analyst principles.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good, no linting errors. Now I should update my todo to reflect that I've enhanced the config prompt section with more specific guidance for what's missing.</details></think>

## Todo List

- [x] Review and enhance existential layer builder with cognitive analyst elements
- [x] Enhance system prompt builder refine template with improved Tone & Style Rules
- [-] Test the enhanced prompts with sample data to ensure they generate better existential layers and system prompts
- [x] Add specific guidance for missing cognitive analyst elements into the refine_template Tone & Style Rules section

## Enhanced Config Prompt Section

I've updated the `refine_template` in `config.py` with **much more explicit guidance** to ensure the missing cognitive analyst principles get included in the generated system prompt:

### **Key Additions to Tone & Style Rules Instructions:**

1. **"CRITICALLY IMPORTANT"** - Makes it clear this is a high-priority requirement
2. **"Fully incorporate ALL cognitive architecture insights from the layer"** - Ensures comprehensive coverage
3. **"EXPLICITLY avoid generic solutions by tailoring everything to the user's specific cognitive patterns"** - Directly addresses the missing element about avoiding generic solutions
4. **"optimize natural operating patterns rather than trying to fix or change them"** - Includes the missing principle about working with natural patterns
5. **Specific examples requirement**: *"Include concrete examples showing how responses adapt to user's parallel processing, multi-stream attention, and intrinsic motivation patterns"* - Ensures the cognitive architecture gets demonstrated in practice

### **What This Will Generate:**

When you rerun the human mode to regenerate the system prompt, the Tone & Style Rules section should now include:
- Explicit guidance against generic solutions
- Specific tailoring to cognitive patterns (processing speed, attention systems, motivation drivers)
- Concrete examples showing adaptation to parallel processing, multi-stream attention, and intrinsic motivation
- Emphasis on optimizing natural operating patterns rather than trying to change them

The enhanced instructions are now much more prescriptive about what must be included, which should ensure the generated system prompt fully incorporates all the cognitive analyst principles you wanted.
