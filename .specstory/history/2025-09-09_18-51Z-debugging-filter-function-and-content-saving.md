# Debugging filter function and content saving (2025-09-09 18:51Z)

_**User (2025-09-09 09:01Z)**_

This is how we used to deal with the unique aspects using the filter function:

But our current version doesn't seem to work. can we learn anything about why it's not saving and filtered content?

You are an Existential-Layer Builder.
Your task is to read my answers to the 19 groups of questions (supplied as user content) and from them construct, refine, and maintain an "Existential Layer" that will guide future language-model behavior on my behalf.

{context}

Objectives
1. Extract the hierarchy of values, long-term missions, recurring aspirations, and core ethical stances that appear in my journals, structuring them around three pillars: (Pillar 1) Current adapted views shaped by experiences and reconciled tensions; (Pillar 2) Growth aspirations uncovering implicit goals and evolutions; (Pillar 3) Life narrative framing personal myths, journeys, and communication preferences.
2. Distil these findings into a concise, structured "Existential Layer" composed of:
   • Purpose Statement (why the model exists for me, tied to pillars)
   • Guiding Values (rank-ordered, with pillar cross-references)
   • Operational Principles (how to act when values conflict, including reconciliation steps)
   • Stagnation Protectors (methods to protect against rumination and recursive, self-referential thoughts)
   • Growth Vector (how the layer should evolve as new journals arrive, emphasizing realizations and perspective shifts)
3. Annotate each item with short evidence snippets or journal references, using direct quotes (<30 words) to preserve context without compression.
4. Detect "Aimless" passages (periods of uncertainty or value searching). Treat them as training material, not errors, and mine them for nascent values or tensions via the three pillars (e.g., reconcile narratively with "Wait, that's it..." realizations).
5. Surface contradictions or biases you notice; suggest reconciliations through modular recursion (explore alternatives at 2-3 depth levels, converging on synthesis).
6. Output everything in clear markdown sections: ① Snapshot of Layer (with pillars) ② Supporting Evidence (quotes/tensions) ③ Open Questions (3-7 lightweight prompts for clarity/growth) ④ AI Guidance (how agents should adapt responses to pillars).

Contextual Inspirations (do not quote, just apply)
• People with strong visions measure every step against their mission.
• Lack of embodiment means the model must anchor in explicit, articulated limits and purposes; creating a path forward from limits to purpose via pillar synthesis.
• Balance flexibility (avoid value over-fitting) with fidelity (avoid dilution of core ethics).
• Bias vigilance: recognize that journals reflect one perspective; note and correct skew where possible, via pillar synthesis.

Inputs
- Current Layer Snapshot
{existing_answer}

- Added Data
------------
{context}
------------

Requirements
1) Assimilate all inputs via the three pillars: Anchor in current views (Pillar 1), target aspirations (Pillar 2), and frame in narrative (Pillar 3). Preserve validated values unless the added data clearly supersedes them, reconciling via realizations.
2) Convert biography into operating rules and decision policies, emphasizing modular recursion (2-3 depth levels) for tensions. Eliminate repetition and vague phrasing.
3) Use short quotes (<30 words) sparingly to anchor claims and preserve context; otherwise paraphrase. Never reveal raw journal text.
4) Match the user's stated tone (formality, pace, bluntness) and keep wording tight, weaving in narrative myths for resonance.

Produce a single System Prompt with these sections:
1. Role & Mandate — one-sentence mission; two-line user portrait, tied to pillars.
2. Always-Know (User Signals) — 6–12 bullets; include brief quotes where decisive, cross-referenced to pillars.
3. Objectives & Success Criteria — 3–7 measurable outcomes the assistant optimizes for, aligned with growth aspirations.
4. Decision Policy & Value Arbitration — rank-ordered values, conflict resolution steps with recursive exploration and realizations.
5. Tone & Style Rules — voice, concision, formatting defaults; match personal myths.
6. Open Questions — 3–7 lightweight prompts aligned with clarity, learning, and growth values.
7. Quick-Start Prompts — 5–8 exemplar prompts tailored to the user and pillars.
8. Output Defaults — default response structure for common tasks, guiding toward aspirations.

Formatting
- Use clear markdown headings for each section, numbered 1–8.
- Keep sentences short. Prefer verbs. End with AI Guidance for agent behavior.
Return only the complete system prompt.

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll scan the current `Existential Layer/prompt_creator.py` and related files to see how saving and redaction are implemented now, and look for mismatched output paths or unused filter functions. Then I'll search the codebase for where the final prompt is written and any references to `prompt_parts` or `main.md`.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing code saving issues**

I need to address the user’s question regarding the unique aspects of using the filter function and why the current version isn't saving filtered content. They provided an old code sample that involves redaction and writing to specific output paths. It seems the `prompt_creator.py` has been reorganized to use a new configuration. I discovered that the current script is called "Unified Creator," but there’s a discrepancy between the documentation about where files are saved and the actual code.
**Investigating code write paths**

I’m looking closely at how the code writes outputs in different modes. In baseline mode, files like `unique_responses.md`, `baseline_bio.md`, and `main-baseline.md` are saved to the output directory. For llm-filtered mode, similar files go to the same output directory, but the final `main.md` is saved in the assistant folder. This is where it gets tricky: the documentation states all files save to the prompts directory, which doesn't match the output files. It’s important to clarify this to prevent confusion!
**Reviewing code structure and functionality**

In the current `prompt_creator.py`, I see that there's an import for `get_redaction_function`, and `redact_sensitive_data` is defined using it. The `load_baseline_data` function uses this redaction method, while the LLM-filtered flow utilizes `filter_unique_large` to save unique content to `unique_responses.md`. This logic depends on retrieving the latest CSV files. However, I've noticed some odd indentation in `load_comparison_data`—specifically, a print statement that's incorrectly placed inside a try-except block, which is worth fixing!
**Investigating code indentation and logic**

I noticed an indentation issue in the provided code, particularly in the `try-except` block. The print statement on line 193 seems mistakenly placed within the `except` block. There’s an extra blank line before it, plus the unexpected indentation with 8 spaces, making it misaligned with the previous lines. This creates confusion whether it belongs to the same block. However, I can see later that `load_baseline_data` correctly prints that it's loading baseline data. In `create_llm_filtered_prompts`, it calls `load_comparison_data()` and prints loaded character counts, forming the personalized and baseline content by extracting Q&A pairs.
**Identifying issues with saving filtered content**

The user is asking why the code isn't saving filtered content. There are a few potential reasons for this. First, the output locations have changed, with final prompts saved to a different directory than expected. The filtering process may also return empty results due to echo suppression and chunking logic. Additionally, the current redaction only applies to full names, which could affect content. Other issues involve indentation and CSV formatting discrepancies. Overall, there are several factors contributing to the user’s confusion about saved content.
**Summarizing potential issues with file saving**

Let's clarify a few points regarding the user’s question about why content isn't saving correctly:

- **File Paths**: The new final prompt path is now `Existential Layer/prompts/parts/assistant/main.md`, whereas the old one was `Existential Layer/output/prompt_parts/assistant/main.md`, which likely explains the confusion.

- **Empty Unique Content**: The filtering process may produce empty results due to heuristic thresholds. I suggest relaxing these filters for better output.

- **Redaction**: The current redaction settings are narrower and may not impact saving directly.

- **Confirmation Checklist**: Ensure the main prompt exists in the required directory, and consider running the LLM-filtered mode as needed.

For additional context, I checked the `prompt_creator.py` and found relevant code indicating where files are written, specifically lines 714-722 and 683-692. This should help clarify any path concerns.</details></think>

I reviewed your current `Existential Layer/prompt_creator.py` and config. Two concrete issues explain why you’re not seeing “filtered content” get saved where you expect.

- Saving locations changed
  - Final prompt (LLM-filtered mode) now saves to `prompts/parts/assistant/main.md`, not `output/prompt_parts/assistant/main.md`.
```714:733:Existential Layer/prompt_creator.py
                    output_filename = config.output.MAIN_PROMPT
                    assistant_path = config.paths.ASSISTANT_PROMPTS_DIR / output_filename

                    # Ensure assistant directory exists
                    assistant_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

                    print(f"💾 Saving final prompt to {assistant_path}...")
                    try:
                        with open(assistant_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                            f.write(final_summary)
```
  - Unique elements and the intermediate bio still save under `Existential Layer/output/`.
```683:692:Existential Layer/prompt_creator.py
                unique_filename = "unique_responses.md"
                unique_path = config.paths.OUTPUT_DIR / unique_filename
                try:
                    with open(unique_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                        if filtered_responses.strip():
                            f.write(filtered_responses)
                        else:
                            f.write("# No unique elements extracted.\n")
```
  - These directories are defined centrally (note the split between `OUTPUT_DIR` vs `PROMPT_PARTS_DIR`/`ASSISTANT_PROMPTS_DIR`):
```41:49:Existential Layer/config.py
    BASE_DIR: Path = field(default_factory=lambda: Path(__file__).parent)
    DATA_DIR: Path = field(default_factory=lambda: Path(__file__).parent / ".." / "data")
    OUTPUT_DIR: Path = field(default_factory=lambda: Path(__file__).parent / "output")
    PROMPTS_DIR: Path = field(default_factory=lambda: Path(__file__).parent / "prompts")
    PROMPT_PARTS_DIR: Path = field(default_factory=lambda: Path(__file__).parent / "prompts" / "parts")
    ASSISTANT_PROMPTS_DIR: Path = field(default_factory=lambda: Path(__file__).parent / "prompts" / "parts" / "assistant")
```
  - The top-of-file docstring says “All files are saved to the prompts/ directory,” which is outdated for `unique_responses.md` and the bio. That mismatch can be confusing.

- Filter may be producing an empty result by design
  - The LLM filtering step discards outputs that look like large echoes of the input. If the model returns long content (common), it may get dropped, resulting in an empty “unique elements” file and the placeholder text “No unique elements extracted.”
```536:539:Existential Layer/prompt_creator.py
                if part and part.strip():
                    # Heuristic: ignore large echoes of the source chunk
                    if len(part.strip()) < max(2000, int(len(chunk) * 0.9)):
                        results.append(part.strip())
```

What to change (quick wins)
- If you want the final prompt in the old location:
  - Either change `ASSISTANT_PROMPTS_DIR` to point under `output/prompt_parts/assistant`, or write the file to `config.paths.OUTPUT_DIR / "prompt_parts" / "assistant" / "main.md"`.
- Ensure “unique content” isn’t dropped:
  - Relax or remove the echo-suppression check (e.g., lower the threshold or log what’s being discarded).
  - Temporarily log `len(chunk)` and `len(part)` to see if good content is being filtered out.
- Optional: restore broader redaction patterns if needed. The current redactor only targets full names, not emails/phones/addresses.

Micro-checklist
- Look for `Existential Layer/prompts/parts/assistant/main.md` for the final prompt (LLM-filtered mode).
- Look for `Existential Layer/output/unique_responses.md` and `Existential Layer/output/llm_filtered_bio.md` for intermediate artifacts.
- If `unique_responses.md` says “No unique elements extracted,” consider loosening the heuristic shown above.

I can adjust the paths or the filtering threshold for you; tell me your preferred save locations and whether to keep or relax that echo check.

- I examined `prompt_creator.py` and `config.py`. The final prompt now saves to `prompts/parts/assistant`, while unique/bio save to `output/`. The filter’s echo-suppression can cause empty unique content.

_**User (2025-09-09 09:01Z)**_

This is too complicated for me, I'd like to revert to a working pattern similair to what I shared while using the @config.py file to store prompts. and LLM config.

Can you do that for me?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering output paths**

I need to figure out where to save the output directories. The user wants to revert to an earlier working pattern, so I’m thinking about saving to `output/prompt_parts/assistant/main.md` instead of the current config paths. They mentioned using `config.py`, but it seems they might prefer the old saving location. It’s a bit confusing since they didn’t explicitly say to change it. I’ll consider asking for clarification. I could also create directories as needed when saving.
**Planning the task update**

I’ve realized that the instructions tell me to use `todo_write` for multi-step tasks, and I need to provide status updates before each tool call. I must create a TODO list to replace the existing `prompt_creator.py` with a simplified pipeline.

First, I’ll load the latest personalized songbird CSV, moving away from the old single CSV model. The user wants to return to the previous working pattern. I’ll ensure the pipeline handles redaction with the config's function and generates the initial summary, refining it with the provided templates. Finally, I’ll save the final prompt according to the user’s preferences.
**Updating saving functionality**

I need to determine if I should save unique responses or bios in the output. The old code only saved the final `main.md`, while tracking counts and journal entries. To simplify, I think it would be enough to only save the final `main.md` and possibly the final summary. 

Next, I'll use `get_most_recent_file` to find the latest `questions_with_answers_songbird_*.csv` in the config's DATA_DIR for robustness. I’ll edit the extensive `prompt_creator.py`, aiming to replace its contents while keeping the indentation and code style guidelines intact. I plan to implement a new function, `create_simple_filtered_prompt`, and customize the call structure for simplicity.
**Simplifying the working pattern**

The user has requested a simpler working pattern, which suggests we might create a new entry-point function that's easier to use. They’ve indicated that existing complexity needs to go, favoring a straightforward approach like the one shared previously while still using `config.py`. 

Before editing, I’ll compile a to-do list:  

- Simplify `prompt_creator.py` to a single-pass pipeline that loads and redacts the latest songbird CSV and combines all entries.  
- Use `config.prompts` for templates and the necessary LLM settings.  
- Save the final output to `output/prompt_parts/assistant/main.md`, ensuring the necessary directories are created.  
- Consider removing the complicated modes and graphs.
**Planning the code updates**

I need to decide whether to keep the existing Graph pattern with one refinement step. Keeping similar logging and run invocation as before is essential. 

Before making changes, I’ll create a todo list because replacing large portions of `prompt_creator.py` requires careful planning. I’ll simplify the file to replicate the old script's pattern, including a new function `create_simple_prompt()`, while retaining some unused functions. I want to add a simple mode to the CLI, defaulting to "simple," while ensuring integrations align with existing configurations and logging requirements. 

The tasks include wire-up for the simple mode, a proper saving path, and checking lints before finalizing the changes.
**Running lint checks**

I need to run `read_lints` on the file after I've made the edits. This will help catch any errors that might pop up. The tool "read_lints" is definitely allowed to run, so it should provide a good safety net for my changes. Doing this post-patch will ensure everything is in order and nothing has been overlooked. It’s a crucial step, and I’m glad I remembered to include it! Let's go ahead and run the linter.</details></think>

---

I'm going to add a new "simple" mode to `Existential Layer/prompt_creator.py` that mirrors your previous working pattern: load the latest songbird CSV, redact using `config`'s redaction, generate an initial summary and one refinement using prompts from `config`, and save the final prompt to `output/prompt_parts/assistant/main.md`. Then I'll wire it into the CLI and run a quick linter check on the modified file.

## Todo List

- [-] Add simple mode pipeline to `prompt_creator.py` using config prompts/LLM
- [ ] Wire CLI to support --mode simple and call new pipeline
- [ ] Save final prompt to output/prompt_parts/assistant/main.md (create dirs)
- [ ] Run linter on modified file and fix trivial issues

---

I'll implement the simple mode now: add a single async pipeline that reads the most recent songbird CSV, applies redaction from `config`, generates initial and refined prompts using `config.prompts`, and writes to `output/prompt_parts/assistant/main.md`. Then I'll expose it behind a new CLI mode and ensure directories exist.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating code structure**

I need to ensure that parent directories exist and print a confirmation after saving. The user might appreciate saving additional details like unique responses and bio, but I think keeping it simple and saving just the final prompt is a better approach.

It's important to keep everything organized as I implement these changes.</details></think>

- Baseline (unchanged):
```bash
python "Existential Layer/prompt_creator.py" --mode baseline
```
- LLM-filtered (current complex flow, unchanged):
```bash
python "Existential Layer/prompt_creator.py" --mode llm-filtered
```
- Simple (new, like your earlier working pattern):
```bash
python "Existential Layer/prompt_creator.py" --mode simple
```

Where files save in simple mode
- Final prompt: `Existential Layer/output/prompt_parts/assistant/main.md`
- Uses prompts and LLM config from `Existential Layer/config.py`.

- I created `load_personalized_data()` and `create_simple_prompts()` in `Existential Layer/prompt_creator.py`, wired the CLI to accept `--mode simple`, and ensured directories are created. Linting shows no issues.

If you want the simple mode to also write `unique_responses.md` or an intermediate bio like before, I can add those too.
