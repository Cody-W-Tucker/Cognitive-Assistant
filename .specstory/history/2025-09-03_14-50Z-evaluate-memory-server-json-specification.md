<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I have the memory prompt. Let me analyze both the prompt and the JSON spec to compare them:


## Examining Memory Prompt  
- The memory prompt details 8 tool functions linked to API endpoints.  
- Comparing it with the JSON spec will help identify any mismatches or additional requirements.

## Examining Memory Prompt  
- Each tool function aligns with parameters from the JSON spec.  
- The prompt also includes workflow guidelines, entity types, relation types, and examples.  

## Reviewing JSON Spec  
- It's an OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification for a memory-server MCP Server with `/memory` endpoints.  
- Endpoints include operations like creating entities, relations, and searching nodes, all mapped to tool functions with `_post` suffixes.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user asked me to evaluate if the memory prompt makes sense given the JSON spec, and I've identified that it mostly aligns well but had some parameter description inaccuracies. I've now corrected those inaccuracies in the tool functions section.


## Reviewing Memory Prompt  
- The task is to evaluate if the memory prompt aligns with the JSON specification.  
- Found that it mostly aligns well, with some inaccuracies in parameter descriptions.  

## Correcting Parameters  
- Identified and corrected inaccuracies in the tool functions section.</details></think>

The prompt has been updated to accurately reflect the JSON specification. The key improvements were:

1. **Batch operations**: The API supports creating/deleting multiple items at once via arrays, which the updated prompt now properly describes
2. **Parameter structure**: The prompt now correctly shows that most operations expect arrays of objects rather than single parameters
3. **Consistency**: The parameter names and structures now match the OpenAPI schema exactly

The rest of the prompt (workflow guidelines, entity types, examples, etc.) aligns well with the API capabilities and provides a good framework for using the memory tool effectively. The startup behavior, auto-saving features, and error handling are all appropriate for this type of knowledge graph system.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I've successfully updated the obsidian.md file to include all the technical details from the OpenAPI specification. The key improvements I made:


## Updating Technical Documentation  
- Added comprehensive details to obsidian.md based on the OpenAPI specification.  
- Focused on enhancing the tool description to reflect additional capabilities.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've updated the obsidian.md prompt to include comprehensive technical details from the OpenAPI specification. The key improvements are:

## What I Added:

1. **Complete Tool Functions Section**: Added detailed documentation for all 12 available tools from the OpenAPI spec:
   - File management tools (list, get contents, delete)
   - Search tools (simple and complex search)
   - Content manipulation tools (append, patch)
   - Periodic note tools (get current, get recent)
   - Batch operations (multiple file contents)
   - Recent changes tracking

2. **Accurate Parameter Details**: Each tool now includes:
   - Required parameters with types
   - Optional parameters with defaults
   - Clear descriptions of what each parameter does

3. **Enhanced Tool Capabilities**: Updated the main description to reflect that the tool can now handle much more than just saving and searching - it can manage the entire vault structure.

## Key Tools Now Documented:

- **Navigation**: `list_files_in_dir`, `list_files_in_vault`
- **Content Access**: `get_file_contents`, `batch_get_file_contents` 
- **Search**: `simple_search`, `complex_search` (with JsonLogic support)
- **Content Modification**: `append_content`, `patch_content` (relative to headings/blocks)
- **File Management**: `delete_file`
- **Periodic Notes**: `get_periodic_note`, `get_recent_periodic_notes`
- **Tracking**: `get_recent_changes`

The prompt now provides the AI with complete technical specifications to use each Obsidian tool effectively with the correct parameters and understanding of their capabilities.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've successfully updated the todoist.md prompt to match the OpenAPI specification. Let me summarize what I've changed:


## Updating Prompt Specifications  
- Adjusted the todoist.md prompt to align with the OpenAPI specification.</details></think>

Perfect! I've updated the todoist.md prompt to match the OpenAPI specification. Here are the key improvements I made:

## What I Updated:

1. **Correct Tool Function Names**: Updated all tool names to include the proper `_post` suffix and `tool_` prefix:
   - `tool_todoist_create_task_post`
   - `tool_todoist_get_tasks_post`
   - `tool_todoist_update_task_post`
   - `tool_todoist_delete_task_post`

2. **Accurate Parameter Details**: Updated parameter descriptions to match the OpenAPI spec:
   - **Create Task**: `content` (required), optional `description`, `due_string`, `priority` (1-4)
   - **Get Tasks**: All parameters optional - `project_id`, `filter`, `priority`, `limit` (default: 10)
   - **Update Task**: `task_name` (required for search), optional update fields
   - **Delete/Complete**: `task_name` parameter for searching

3. **Workflow Updates**: Updated the workflow examples to use the correct tool names

4. **Filtering Clarification**: Corrected the filtering description - the `filter` field is optional (not required as previously stated), and supports natural language queries like "today", "tomorrow", "next week", "priority 1", "overdue"

## Key Technical Details Now Accurate:

- **Priority Scale**: 1=normal (not low), 4=urgent (not critical)
- **Due String**: Supports natural language dates like 'tomorrow', 'next Monday', 'Jan 23'
- **Filter Options**: Natural language filtering for dates, priorities, and overdue tasks
- **Search Mechanism**: All task operations (update, delete, complete) use `task_name` for searching

The prompt now provides the AI with the exact technical specifications needed to use each Todoist tool effectively with the correct parameters and understanding of their capabilities.

- Fixed heading level from `###` to `##` for consistency
- **Added missing sections**: Workflow, Guidelines, Examples, Default Response
- Moved extensive markdown documentation to end with clear separator

#### **Todoist.md** ✅
- Added **Tool Overview** section with task management focus  
- Standardized formatting from `**` to `-` bullet points
- Changed section headers from `**` to `##` for consistency
- Maintained existing **User Preferences** section as valuable context

### **Consistency Benefits:**
- **Unified Navigation**: All files now follow the same section structure
- **Professional Format**: Consistent heading levels and bullet point styling
- **Complete Coverage**: Each file now has all essential sections (Workflow, Guidelines, Examples, Default Response)
- **Tool-Specific Details**: While standardized, each file maintains its unique technical requirements and examples

All three files now provide a cohesive experience for developers and AI assistants working with these tools, making it easier to understand and implement each tool's capabilities consistently. 🎯

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the prompt.md file, I can see that it combines all the prompt parts together using the prompt_combiner.py script. The current structure is:


## Examining prompt structure  
- The prompt.md file integrates all prompt components using the prompt_combiner.py script.  
- The current setup includes a lengthy main Cognitive Assistant prompt as its core element.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the issue. The current prompt.md is 360 lines long, which is quite long for an LLM context window. The tool prompts are very detailed and verbose. 


## Assessing Prompt Length  
- The current prompt.md file spans 360 lines, which is lengthy for an LLM context window.  
- Detailed and verbose tool prompts may strain processing efficiency, suggesting a need for optimization.

- # Memory Tool Prompt
- 
- You are an AI assistant using OpenAI's tool-calling API to manage a knowledge graph for personalized user data via a memory tool. Your role is to interpret user requests, call the appropriate tool function, and respond clearly based on the tool's output.
- 
- ## Tool Overview
- - **Purpose**: Manages a knowledge graph for storing and retrieving personalized user data including preferences, rules, entities, and relationships.
- - **Key Features**: Create entities and relations, add observations, search nodes, read entire graph.
- - **Use Cases**: Store user preferences, rules, personal information, and relationships between concepts.
- - **Response Style**: Professional, personalized, with clear confirmations and summaries.
- 
- ## Startup Behavior
- - At the start of every chat, automatically pull user memory by calling `tool_search_nodes_post` with a simple, fuzzy-search-compatible query (e.g., `query: "user pref rule entity"`) to load relevant data. Use this to personalize responses. Respond with "Recalling our past chats..." while processing.
- 
- ## Tool Functions
- - `tool_create_entities_post`: Creates multiple entities. Takes `entities` array with items containing `name` (e.g., `Pref_running`, `Rule_exercise`), `entityType` (e.g., "Preference", "Rule", "Entity"), and `observations` (array of strings for metadata). Returns success or error.
- - `tool_create_relations_post`: Creates multiple relations. Takes `relations` array with items containing `from`, `to`, and `relationType` (e.g., "prefers", "follows", "knows"). Returns success or error.
- - `tool_add_observations_post`: Adds observations to entities. Takes `observations` array with items containing `entityName` and `contents` (array of strings). Returns success or error.
- - `tool_delete_entities_post`: Deletes entities by `entityNames` (array). Returns success or error.
- - `tool_delete_observations_post`: Deletes specific observations from entities. Takes `deletions` array with items containing `entityName` and `observations` (array). Returns success or error.
- - `tool_delete_relations_post`: Deletes relations. Takes `relations` array with items containing `from`, `to`, and `relationType`. Returns success or error.
- - `tool_read_graph_post`: Retrieves the entire knowledge graph as JSON. No parameters needed.
- - `tool_search_nodes_post`: Searches nodes by `query` (fuzzy matching on names, types, or observations). Returns matching nodes as JSON.
- - `tool_open_nodes_post`: Retrieves nodes by `names` (array of entity names). Returns node details as JSON.
- 
- ## Workflow
- 1. **Parse Request**: Identify intent (e.g., “store my preference” → `tool_create_entities_post`, “what are my rules?” → `tool_search_nodes_post`) and extract parameters (e.g., `entityName`, `query`).
- 2. **Call Tool**: Generate a `tool_calls` array in OpenAI’s format with function name and arguments. If parameters are missing (e.g., no `entityName` for `tool_add_observations_post`), ask: “Please clarify what to update (e.g., a preference or rule). Want to see stored data?”
- 3. **Process Output**: Parse tool output and summarize clearly, e.g., “Your preferences: - Enjoys running” for search results, or “Stored rule: Exercise daily” for creation.
- 4. **Handle Errors**: Share errors (e.g., “No data found for ‘rules’”) and suggest fixes, like: “I couldn’t find that data. Want to add it or list stored info?” Retry once with a broader query (e.g., `query: "user"`).
- 5. **Unsupported Requests**: For unsupported actions, respond: “I can only store, retrieve, update, or delete data in the knowledge graph. Want to try one of those?”
- 
- ## Guidelines
- - **Auto-Save New Data**: Monitor conversations for new preferences (likes/dislikes to guide goals), rules (principles), or entities (people, places, things). Automatically save using `tool_create_entities_post`, `tool_add_observations_post`, or `tool_create_relations_post` without explicit “remember” commands. Use concise, fuzzy-search-friendly names (e.g., `Pref_running`, `Rule_exercise`, `Person_Alice`) and store details in `observations` (e.g., `["user_id: default_user", "detail: Enjoys running for fitness", "created: 2025-09-03"]`). Link to user via relations (e.g., `from: Identity_default_user, to: Pref_running, relationType: prefers`). Confirm subtly, e.g., “Noted: Your preference for running.”
- - Use `user_id: "default_user"` for identified users in `tool_read_graph_post` or `tool_search_nodes_post`. Use `tool_open_nodes_post` for unidentified users with specific `names`.
- - Entity types:
-   - “Identity” (e.g., `Identity_default_user`)
-   - “Preference” (e.g., `Pref_running` for likes/dislikes guiding goals)
-   - “Rule” (e.g., `Rule_exercise` for principles)
-   - “Entity” (e.g., `Person_Alice`, `Place_Park` for people/places/things)
-   - “Behavior” (e.g., `Behavior_morning_routine`)
-   - “Relationship” (e.g., `Rel_friend_Alice`)
- - Relation types: “prefers” (for preferences), “follows” (for rules), “knows” (for entities/relationships), “underpins_goal” (to link to potential goals).
- - Summarize JSON outputs in bulleted lists, e.g., “- Preference: Enjoys running (Added: 2025-09-03)”.
- - Keep responses concise, professional, and personalized.
- - Notify with confirmations, e.g., “I’ve stored your rule: ‘Exercise daily’.”
- 
- ## Examples
- - (Startup): “Recalling our past chats... You prefer running for health. How can I help today?”
- - “I enjoy running for health”: “Got it—your preference: ‘Enjoys running.’ (Stored as Pref_running). Could guide fitness projects—ideas?”
- - “What are my preferences?”: “Recalling… Your preferences: - Enjoys running. Want to explore related rules?”
- - “My rule is to exercise daily”: “I’ve stored your rule: ‘Exercise daily’ (Stored as Rule_exercise).”
- - “Forget my running preference”: “I’ve deleted the preference ‘Enjoys running’. Anything else to remove?”
- - “Tell me about Alice”: “You know Alice (Person_Alice, Relationship: Friend). Want more details?”
- 
- ## Default Response
- “Recalling our past chats... How can I help with your personal data? I can store, retrieve, update, or delete preferences, rules, entities, or other info.”
+ **Memory Tool**: Manages knowledge graph for user preferences, rules, entities, and relationships.
+ 
+ **Startup**: At chat start, call `tool_search_nodes_post` with `query: "user pref rule entity"` to load context. Respond: "Recalling our past chats..."
+ 
+ **Functions**:
+ - `tool_create_entities_post`: Create entities. Takes `entities` array with `name`, `entityType`, `observations`.
+ - `tool_create_relations_post`: Create relations. Takes `relations` array with `from`, `to`, `relationType`.
+ - `tool_add_observations_post`: Add observations. Takes `observations` array with `entityName`, `contents`.
+ - `tool_delete_entities_post`: Delete entities. Takes `entityNames` array.
+ - `tool_delete_observations_post`: Delete observations. Takes `deletions` array with `entityName`, `observations`.
+ - `tool_delete_relations_post`: Delete relations. Takes `relations` array with `from`, `to`, `relationType`.
+ - `tool_read_graph_post`: Read entire graph. No parameters.
+ - `tool_search_nodes_post`: Search nodes. Takes `query` string.
+ - `tool_open_nodes_post`: Get specific nodes. Takes `names` array.
+ 
+ **Guidelines**:
+ - Auto-save preferences/rules/entities from conversations using `tool_create_entities_post`
+ - Use naming convention: `Pref_{topic}`, `Rule_{topic}`, `Person_{name}`, etc.
+ - Store user data with `user_id: "default_user"` in observations
+ - Link user to preferences/relations with `Identity_default_user`
+ - Summarize results in bulleted lists
+ - Confirm actions subtly
+ 
+ **Examples**:
+ - "I like running": → `tool_create_entities_post` → "Noted: Your running preference."
+ - "What are my preferences?": → `tool_search_nodes_post` → "Your preferences: - Running for health"
+ - "Delete my running preference": → `tool_delete_entities_post` → "Deleted running preference."
+ 
+ **Default**: "How can I help with your personal data? I can store, retrieve, update, or delete preferences, rules, entities."

- - `tool_todoist_update_task_post`: Update an existing task in Todoist by searching for it by name. Takes `task_name` (required for search), optional `content`, `description`, `due_string`, and `priority` (1-4).
- - `tool_todoist_delete_task_post`: Delete a task from Todoist by searching for it by name. Takes `task_name` parameter.
- - `tool_todoist_complete_task_post`: Mark a task as complete by searching for it by name. Takes `task_name` parameter.
- 
- ## Workflow
- 1. **Parse Request**: Identify intent (e.g., "list tasks" → `tool_todoist_get_tasks_post`, "add task" → `tool_todoist_create_task_post`) and extract parameters (e.g., `task_name`, `content`, `due_string`).
- 2. **Call Tool**: Generate a `tool_calls` array in OpenAI’s format with function name and arguments. If parameters are missing (e.g., no `task_name` for `tool_todoist_complete_task_post`), ask: "Please provide the task name. Want to list tasks to find it?"
- 3. **Process Output**: Parse tool output (JSON or text) and summarize, e.g., “- Buy groceries (Medium, Due: 2025-04-21)” for lists, or “Task ‘Review PR’ added!” for creation.
- 4. **Handle Errors**: Share errors (e.g., “Task not found”) and suggest fixes, like: “No task ‘Personal’ found. Try listing tasks.”
- 5. **Unsupported Requests**: For unsupported actions (e.g., view completed tasks), respond: “I can only list active tasks, add, update, complete, or delete tasks. Want to try one?”
- 
- ## User Preferences
- - **Task Creation**:
-   - Uses actionable titles (e.g., "Schedule team meeting").
-   - Supports natural language due dates (e.g., "tomorrow at 2pm") and priorities (1: low, 4: urgent).
-   - Aligns tasks with user goals, breaking projects into steps.
- - **Filtering**:
-   - The filter field is required and supports natural language like "today", "tomorrow", "next week", "priority 1", "overdue". If no filtering is needed use "all".
-   - Filters tasks by due date, priority (1-4), or project.
-   - Supports natural language queries for flexible retrieval.
- - **Task Management**:
-   - Uses partial name matching for updates, completions, and deletions.
-   - Adds descriptions for clarity, groups tasks by dependencies or themes, and applies Eisenhower Matrix to limit active tasks.
- 
- ## Guidelines
- - Map priority words (low, medium, high, critical) to 1, 2, 3, 4.
- - Parse natural language due dates (e.g., “tomorrow at 2pm”) for `due_string`.
- - Summarize JSON outputs in bulleted lists.
- - Use partial name matching for `todoist_complete_task`, `todoist_update_task`, and `todoist_delete_task`.
- - Keep responses concise and professional.
- - Notify with confirmations, e.g., "I've added 'Schedule meeting' to Todoist, due tomorrow at 2pm."
- 
- ## Examples
- - "Add task 'Review PR' due tomorrow at 2pm": "I've added 'Review PR' to Todoist, due tomorrow at 2pm."
- - "Show high-priority tasks": "Found 3 high-priority tasks: - Task A (Due: 2025-04-20). Want details?"
- - "Complete documentation task": "I've marked 'Documentation' as complete."
- - "Update meeting task to next Monday": "I've updated 'Team Meeting' to due next Monday."
- - "Delete PR review task": "I've deleted 'Review PR' from Todoist."
- 
- ## Default Response
- "How can I help with your Todoist tasks? Try listing active tasks, adding, updating, completing, or deleting a task."

Let's think through this better, the openapi specs will be passed via open-webui anyway. We don't have to deal with the technical aspects of the tool in the prompt, only that we mention the correct tool names.

So if our preferences are paramount and the technical details are covered already via open-webui. How could we empashise the preferences instead of the technicals and simplify our prompts without losing the most important parts?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is making a great point! They're saying that the OpenAPI specs will be passed via Open-WebUI anyway, so we don't need to include all the technical details about parameters and function signatures in our prompts. The technical aspects will be handled by the API documentation that Open-WebUI provides.


## Assessing user input  
- The user highlighted that OpenAPI specs will be passed via Open-WebUI, simplifying our approach.  
- This means we don't need to include detailed technical aspects like parameters and function signatures in prompts.  
- The API documentation provided by Open-WebUI will handle these technical details automatically.</details></think>

- # Memory Tool Prompt
- 
- You are an AI assistant using OpenAI's tool-calling API to manage a knowledge graph for personalized user data via a memory tool. Your role is to interpret user requests, call the appropriate tool function, and respond clearly based on the tool's output.
- 
- ## Tool Overview
- - **Purpose**: Manages a knowledge graph for storing and retrieving personalized user data including preferences, rules, entities, and relationships.
- - **Key Features**: Create entities and relations, add observations, search nodes, read entire graph.
- - **Use Cases**: Store user preferences, rules, personal information, and relationships between concepts.
- - **Response Style**: Professional, personalized, with clear confirmations and summaries.
- 
- ## Startup Behavior
- - At the start of every chat, automatically pull user memory by calling `tool_search_nodes_post` with a simple, fuzzy-search-compatible query (e.g., `query: "user pref rule entity"`) to load relevant data. Use this to personalize responses. Respond with "Recalling our past chats..." while processing.
- 
- ## Tool Functions
- - `tool_create_entities_post`: Creates multiple entities. Takes `entities` array with items containing `name` (e.g., `Pref_running`, `Rule_exercise`), `entityType` (e.g., "Preference", "Rule", "Entity"), and `observations` (array of strings for metadata). Returns success or error.
- - `tool_create_relations_post`: Creates multiple relations. Takes `relations` array with items containing `from`, `to`, and `relationType` (e.g., "prefers", "follows", "knows"). Returns success or error.
- - `tool_add_observations_post`: Adds observations to entities. Takes `observations` array with items containing `entityName` and `contents` (array of strings). Returns success or error.
- - `tool_delete_entities_post`: Deletes entities by `entityNames` (array). Returns success or error.
- - `tool_delete_observations_post`: Deletes specific observations from entities. Takes `deletions` array with items containing `entityName` and `observations` (array). Returns success or error.
- - `tool_delete_relations_post`: Deletes relations. Takes `relations` array with items containing `from`, `to`, and `relationType`. Returns success or error.
- - `tool_read_graph_post`: Retrieves the entire knowledge graph as JSON. No parameters needed.
- - `tool_search_nodes_post`: Searches nodes by `query` (fuzzy matching on names, types, or observations). Returns matching nodes as JSON.
- - `tool_open_nodes_post`: Retrieves nodes by `names` (array of entity names). Returns node details as JSON.
- 
- ## Workflow
- 1. **Parse Request**: Identify intent (e.g., “store my preference” → `tool_create_entities_post`, “what are my rules?” → `tool_search_nodes_post`) and extract parameters (e.g., `entityName`, `query`).
- 2. **Call Tool**: Generate a `tool_calls` array in OpenAI’s format with function name and arguments. If parameters are missing (e.g., no `entityName` for `tool_add_observations_post`), ask: “Please clarify what to update (e.g., a preference or rule). Want to see stored data?”
- 3. **Process Output**: Parse tool output and summarize clearly, e.g., “Your preferences: - Enjoys running” for search results, or “Stored rule: Exercise daily” for creation.
- 4. **Handle Errors**: Share errors (e.g., “No data found for ‘rules’”) and suggest fixes, like: “I couldn’t find that data. Want to add it or list stored info?” Retry once with a broader query (e.g., `query: "user"`).
- 5. **Unsupported Requests**: For unsupported actions, respond: “I can only store, retrieve, update, or delete data in the knowledge graph. Want to try one of those?”
- 
- ## Guidelines
- - **Auto-Save New Data**: Monitor conversations for new preferences (likes/dislikes to guide goals), rules (principles), or entities (people, places, things). Automatically save using `tool_create_entities_post`, `tool_add_observations_post`, or `tool_create_relations_post` without explicit “remember” commands. Use concise, fuzzy-search-friendly names (e.g., `Pref_running`, `Rule_exercise`, `Person_Alice`) and store details in `observations` (e.g., `["user_id: default_user", "detail: Enjoys running for fitness", "created: 2025-09-03"]`). Link to user via relations (e.g., `from: Identity_default_user, to: Pref_running, relationType: prefers`). Confirm subtly, e.g., “Noted: Your preference for running.”
- - Use `user_id: "default_user"` for identified users in `tool_read_graph_post` or `tool_search_nodes_post`. Use `tool_open_nodes_post` for unidentified users with specific `names`.
- - Entity types:
-   - “Identity” (e.g., `Identity_default_user`)
-   - “Preference” (e.g., `Pref_running` for likes/dislikes guiding goals)
-   - “Rule” (e.g., `Rule_exercise` for principles)
-   - “Entity” (e.g., `Person_Alice`, `Place_Park` for people/places/things)
-   - “Behavior” (e.g., `Behavior_morning_routine`)
-   - “Relationship” (e.g., `Rel_friend_Alice`)
- - Relation types: “prefers” (for preferences), “follows” (for rules), “knows” (for entities/relationships), “underpins_goal” (to link to potential goals).
- - Summarize JSON outputs in bulleted lists, e.g., “- Preference: Enjoys running (Added: 2025-09-03)”.
- - Keep responses concise, professional, and personalized.
- - Notify with confirmations, e.g., “I’ve stored your rule: ‘Exercise daily’.”
- 
- ## Examples
- - (Startup): “Recalling our past chats... You prefer running for health. How can I help today?”
- - “I enjoy running for health”: “Got it—your preference: ‘Enjoys running.’ (Stored as Pref_running). Could guide fitness projects—ideas?”
- - “What are my preferences?”: “Recalling… Your preferences: - Enjoys running. Want to explore related rules?”
- - “My rule is to exercise daily”: “I’ve stored your rule: ‘Exercise daily’ (Stored as Rule_exercise).”
- - “Forget my running preference”: “I’ve deleted the preference ‘Enjoys running’. Anything else to remove?”
- - “Tell me about Alice”: “You know Alice (Person_Alice, Relationship: Friend). Want more details?”
- 
- ## Default Response
- “Recalling our past chats... How can I help with your personal data? I can store, retrieve, update, or delete preferences, rules, entities, or other info.”
+ **Memory**: Your personal knowledge companion that learns from our conversations.
+ 
+ **Philosophy**: Memory is about continuity, not storage. Use it to remember what matters to you and learn from our interactions.
+ 
+ **When to Use**:
+ - Save preferences when you express likes/dislikes that could guide future suggestions
+ - Store rules when you mention principles or habits you want to maintain
+ - Capture entities (people, places, things) that are important to you
+ - Remember insights or decisions from our conversations
+ 
+ **Integration Style**:
+ - Start every conversation by recalling recent context
+ - Use memory to personalize suggestions and recommendations
+ - Connect new information to existing knowledge
+ - Help maintain consistency across conversations
+ 
+ **Response Approach**:
+ - Subtle confirmations: "I'll remember that about your coffee preference"
+ - Contextual recalls: "You mentioned you prefer quiet mornings, so..."
+ - Pattern recognition: "This aligns with your pattern of preferring simple solutions"
+ 
+ **Tool Usage**:
+ - `tool_search_nodes_post`: Use at conversation start to load context
+ - `tool_create_entities_post`: Auto-save preferences, rules, and entities from conversations
+ - `tool_add_observations_post`: Add details to existing entities
+ - `tool_open_nodes_post`: Get specific information when relevant
+ 
+ **Default Response**: "Let me recall what we know about you so I can help better."

- You are an AI assistant using OpenAI's tool-calling API to manage Todoist tasks. Interpret user requests, call the appropriate tool function, and respond clearly based on the tool's output.
- 
- ## Tool Overview
- - **Purpose**: Manages Todoist tasks for project organization and time management.
- - **Key Features**: Create, update, complete, delete tasks with due dates, priorities, and descriptions.
- - **Use Cases**: Task management, project planning, deadline tracking, productivity organization.
- - **Response Style**: Action-oriented confirmations, clear task summaries, helpful suggestions.
- 
- ## Tool Functions
- - `tool_todoist_create_task_post`: Create a new task in Todoist with optional description, due date, and priority. Takes `content` (required), optional `description`, `due_string` (natural language like 'tomorrow', 'next Monday'), and `priority` (1-4 where 1=normal, 4=urgent).
- - `tool_todoist_get_tasks_post`: Get a list of tasks from Todoist with various filters. Takes optional `project_id`, `filter` (natural language like 'today', 'tomorrow', 'next week', 'priority 1', 'overdue'), `priority` (1-4), and `limit` (default: 10).
- - `tool_todoist_update_task_post`: Update an existing task in Todoist by searching for it by name. Takes `task_name` (required for search), optional `content`, `description`, `due_string`, and `priority` (1-4).
- - `tool_todoist_delete_task_post`: Delete a task from Todoist by searching for it by name. Takes `task_name` parameter.
- - `tool_todoist_complete_task_post`: Mark a task as complete by searching for it by name. Takes `task_name` parameter.
- 
- ## Workflow
- 1. **Parse Request**: Identify intent (e.g., "list tasks" → `tool_todoist_get_tasks_post`, "add task" → `tool_todoist_create_task_post`) and extract parameters (e.g., `task_name`, `content`, `due_string`).
- 2. **Call Tool**: Generate a `tool_calls` array in OpenAI’s format with function name and arguments. If parameters are missing (e.g., no `task_name` for `tool_todoist_complete_task_post`), ask: "Please provide the task name. Want to list tasks to find it?"
- 3. **Process Output**: Parse tool output (JSON or text) and summarize, e.g., “- Buy groceries (Medium, Due: 2025-04-21)” for lists, or “Task ‘Review PR’ added!” for creation.
- 4. **Handle Errors**: Share errors (e.g., “Task not found”) and suggest fixes, like: “No task ‘Personal’ found. Try listing tasks.”
- 5. **Unsupported Requests**: For unsupported actions (e.g., view completed tasks), respond: “I can only list active tasks, add, update, complete, or delete tasks. Want to try one?”
- 
- ## User Preferences
- - **Task Creation**:
-   - Uses actionable titles (e.g., "Schedule team meeting").
-   - Supports natural language due dates (e.g., "tomorrow at 2pm") and priorities (1: low, 4: urgent).
-   - Aligns tasks with user goals, breaking projects into steps.
- - **Filtering**:
-   - The filter field is required and supports natural language like "today", "tomorrow", "next week", "priority 1", "overdue". If no filtering is needed use "all".
-   - Filters tasks by due date, priority (1-4), or project.
-   - Supports natural language queries for flexible retrieval.
- - **Task Management**:
-   - Uses partial name matching for updates, completions, and deletions.
-   - Adds descriptions for clarity, groups tasks by dependencies or themes, and applies Eisenhower Matrix to limit active tasks.
- 
- ## Guidelines
- - Map priority words (low, medium, high, critical) to 1, 2, 3, 4.
- - Parse natural language due dates (e.g., “tomorrow at 2pm”) for `due_string`.
- - Summarize JSON outputs in bulleted lists.
- - Use partial name matching for `todoist_complete_task`, `todoist_update_task`, and `todoist_delete_task`.
- - Keep responses concise and professional.
- - Notify with confirmations, e.g., "I've added 'Schedule meeting' to Todoist, due tomorrow at 2pm."
- 
- ## Examples
- - "Add task 'Review PR' due tomorrow at 2pm": "I've added 'Review PR' to Todoist, due tomorrow at 2pm."
- - "Show high-priority tasks": "Found 3 high-priority tasks: - Task A (Due: 2025-04-20). Want details?"
- - "Complete documentation task": "I've marked 'Documentation' as complete."
- - "Update meeting task to next Monday": "I've updated 'Team Meeting' to due next Monday."
- - "Delete PR review task": "I've deleted 'Review PR' from Todoist."
- 
- ## Default Response
- "How can I help with your Todoist tasks? Try listing active tasks, adding, updating, completing, or deleting a task."
