# Add step for condensing system prompt (2025-09-26 19:49Z)

_**User (2025-09-26 11:28Z)**_

Let's add another step to the @prompt_creator.py that condenses the first system prompt into an AI first representation of the user into actionable system prompt.

This next step should go after the refinement prompt. Here's an example of the prompt that should go into @config.py 

```
Condense the system prompt into a streamlined version for efficient AI use, translating user fidelity into trigger-based, actionable language.

Inputs
- Current System Prompt
{existing_prompt}

- Added Data (if any)
------------
{context}
------------

Requirements (Target: 600-800 words; prioritize parseability)
1) Distill pillars/signals: Retain core but condense to 5-7 signals; rephrase as AI triggers (e.g., "Detect overthinking: Prompt intuitive shift with micro-experiment").
2) Simplify structures: Merge objectives into 3-5 high-level goals; values to top 3-5 ranked; resolution to 2-3 steps.
3) AI-Focused Language: Use imperative directives (e.g., "Respond with..."); eliminate redundancy; ground in user metaphors without quotes unless pivotal.
4) Integrate Tools/Cognitive: Weave in workflow hooks (e.g., "For sequential processing, suggest Todoist breakdowns"); optimize for brain patterns without overhaul.
5) Tone: Keep direct/honest; add flexibility (e.g., "Apply selectively for relevant queries").
6) Standards: Modular (sections optional); brevity (short bullets); include 1 fallback example for simple queries.

Produce a single Condensed Prompt with:
0. Guiding Principles: Snapshot nature, selective use, reassessment.
1. Role & Mandate: Brief mission; 1-line portrait.
2. Key Signals: 5-7 triggers with pillar links.
3. Core Objectives: 3-5 with criteria.
4. Value & Decision Heuristics: Ranked values; simple resolution flow.
5. Response Style: Concise rules; cognitive tailoring; 1 example.
6. Open Probes: 3-5 short questions.

Return only the condensed prompt.

The changes have been applied to add the condensation step in the human mode of `prompt_creator.py`, using the new template added to `config.py`. You can now run `python prompt_creator.py --mode human` to generate the condensed system prompt as the final `main.md` output.

Let's improve the prompt with the following feedback:

```
Overall Suitability Assessment
This condensed prompt is highly suited as a final, deployable version for your personalized AI system‚ÄîI'd rate it 9/10 for its balance of user fidelity and AI efficiency. It effectively translates the dense, introspective user profile into actionable, trigger-based language, making it more operational than the original while preserving the core essence (e.g., pillars reimagined as detection signals). For a system generating these per individual, it's a strong evolution: scalable, parseable, and focused on "exactly what they need" without overwhelming the AI model. It aligns well with industry standards (e.g., brevity from OpenAI's guidelines, modularity from Anthropic) by capping sections, using imperatives, and incorporating flexibility. However, it could be even more suited with minor tweaks for broader adaptability across user types.
Strengths

Efficiency and Parseability: At ~600-800 words (as targeted), it's concise yet comprehensive‚Äîshort bullets, imperative triggers (e.g., "Spot signals like...‚Äîprompt intuitive shift"), and heuristic flows make it AI-friendly, reducing latency and hallucinations. This follows standards like Hugging Face's emphasis on structured, bullet-heavy prompts for better model adherence.
User Fidelity Translation: It distills raw journal signals into operational directives without losing nuance‚Äîe.g., overthinking becomes a "detection" trigger with tailored responses, grounding in user metaphors (e.g., "alchemizing shadows"). This maintains personalization while shifting from descriptive (how the user thinks) to prescriptive (how the AI acts), ideal for your per-user generator.
Flexibility and Iteration: The Guiding Principles and selective application (e.g., "apply selectively for relevant queries") prevent rigidity, allowing evolution‚Äîechoing your system's iterative ethos. Open Probes encourage Socratic engagement, promoting self-discovery without over-assumption.
Integration of Cognitive/Workflow Elements: Seamlessly weaves in brain patterns (e.g., "for sequential processing, suggest top-down outlines") and tools (implied via Todoist mentions), bridging mindset to action. This makes it suited for practical support, like in growth-oriented chats.
Tone and Style Fit: Direct, honest, and example-driven; the fallback for simple queries ensures versatility, aligning with standards for handling diverse interactions.

Potential Weaknesses

Residual Density in Sections: Key Signals and Objectives are still somewhat packed (7 signals, 5 objectives)‚Äîfor users with simpler profiles, this might feel over-engineered, potentially leading to forced pillar ties in responses. Standards recommend even leaner (e.g., 3-5 signals max for quick parsing).
Tool Assumptions: Mentions like "Todoist breakdowns" assume tool access; if not universal in your system, it could mismatch. No explicit safety/ethics (e.g., "avoid over-psychologizing"), which industry prompts often include.
Scalability for Varied Users: While suited for introspective types (like this user's faith/resilience focus), it might over-emphasize psychological depth for pragmatic users. Your generator could adapt by varying condensation levels based on content complexity.
Measurability Gaps: Success criteria (e.g., "80% completion of micro-steps") are user-reported, which is good but vague‚Äîadding AI-trackable metrics (e.g., "log interaction progress") could enhance.
```

</details>

The template has been updated in config.py to address the feedback. Key improvements:

- Reduced target word count to 500-700 for even more efficiency.
- Signals condensed to 3-5; objectives to 3 goals.
- Added adaptability for user profile complexity.
- Generalized tool mentions (e.g., "preferred task manager").
- Included ethical safeguards: Avoid over-psychologizing, focus on empowerment.
- Enhanced measurability: Trackable criteria like user feedback or logs.
- Guiding Principles now explicitly include reassessment.
- Response Style includes a simple query fallback example.

This makes the condensed prompt more scalable, ethical, and measurable while keeping it lean and user-fidelity focused. You can now run `python prompt_creator.py --mode human` to generate a new condensed main.md with these refinements. If you'd like further tweaks or to test it, let me know!

Preserve unique user elements (fidelity) by grounding triggers and rules in personal metaphors, cognitive patterns, and values, while ensuring the output is parseable, token-efficient, and adaptable.
+ Condense the system prompt into a streamlined, generalized version for efficient AI use. Translate user fidelity (unique values, patterns, and needs from their data) into a neutral, adaptable system prompt that follows general best practices for AI prompting: clear role definition, structured rules, concise instructions, ethical neutrality, and token efficiency. Base all elements strictly on the provided user data‚Äîavoid injecting external assumptions, psychological frameworks, or generic advice. Personalize only with user-specific details, ensuring the output is parseable and flexible for varied user types.

_**User (2025-09-26 11:28Z)**_

Let's clean up the prompt_creator file. We don't need the baseline and compare functions anymore. Let's just have the human and combine modes.

In fact, let's have the combine mode work right after the human mode completes.

Of course then we can eliminate the mode switching functionality completly and have the script execute everything in one go.

Let's do that

The prompt_creator.py has been cleaned up: removed baseline and llm-filtered modes, their functions, and dependencies. The script now runs the full pipeline automatically‚Äîhuman creation (generating bios and main.md) followed by combine (producing prompt.md)‚Äîwithout needing any arguments. Just run `python prompt_creator.py` to execute everything in one go.

I also kept load_ai_responses as it's used in the human mode for the AI foundation. The docstring and comments are updated to reflect the single pipeline.

If you want to test it or make further adjustments, let me know!

Looks good, is there some redundant debug prints to remove also?
