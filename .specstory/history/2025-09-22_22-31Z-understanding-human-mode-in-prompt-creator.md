# Understanding human mode in prompt creator (2025-09-22 22:31Z)

_**User (2025-09-22 17:27Z)**_

Can you tell me how the human mode works in @prompt_creator.py ? I want it to create a initial prompt using only the human interview question/answer file in @data/ then it should refine the prompt using the most reccent question/answers from the newest songbird file

## Investigating prompt creation  
- The user wants to understand how human mode operates in prompt_creator.py.  
- The task involves generating an initial prompt using the human interview question/answer file located in the data/ directory.

## Examining human mode workflow  
- Human mode in prompt_creator.py refines the prompt using the latest question/answers from the newest songbird file after the initial creation.</details></think>

</details></think>

---

Based on the code in `prompt_creator.py`, the human mode (`--mode human`) does exactly what you described! Here's how it works:

## Human Mode Workflow

**Step 1: Load Human Interview Data Only**
- Finds the most recent human interview CSV file in `data/` (currently `human_interview_20250921_171926.csv`)
- Parses the CSV to extract questions and human answers
- Applies redaction to sensitive data
- Formats as Q&A pairs grouped by category

**Step 2: Load AI Refinement Data**
- Finds the most recent songbird CSV file (currently `questions_with_answers_songbird_20250922_125458.csv`) 
- Parses the AI-generated responses for refinement

**Step 3: Create Initial Prompt from Human Data Only**
- Uses `generate_initial_summary()` function
- Calls the LLM with only the human interview context
- Creates an initial existential layer summary based solely on authentic human responses

**Step 4: Refine Using Songbird Data**
- Uses `refine_with_ai_responses()` function  
- Takes the initial human-based summary and refines it using the AI-generated responses
- The AI responses were created using human answers as context/seeds for vector search and RAG

## Files Created

The process creates these intermediate files in `Existential Layer/output/`:
- `human_responses.md` - Raw human interview data
- `human_interview_bio.md` - Initial summary from human data only  
- `ai_refinement_context.md` - The songbird AI responses used for refinement
- `main-human.md` - Final refined prompt combining human foundation + AI insights

## Current Data Files

Your data directory has:
- **Human foundation**: `human_interview_20250921_171926.csv`
- **AI refinement**: `questions_with_answers_songbird_20250922_125458.csv` (newest)

The system maintains the "authentic human foundation" while using AI responses to add deeper insights and refinement, exactly as you wanted! The process ensures the core personality comes from real human input, enhanced by AI-generated context.

_**User (2025-09-22 17:27Z)**_

The @ai_refinement_context.md is blank, are we missing something?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is pointing out that the `ai_refinement_context.md` file is blank (only has an empty line). Looking at the code in the human mode, I can see that this file should contain the AI-generated responses from the songbird CSV file. Let me check what's happening.


## Investigating file issue  
- The user noted that the `ai_refinement_context.md` file is blank, containing only an empty line.  
- This file is supposed to hold AI-generated responses from the songbird CSV file.  
- Let's check why the file appears empty despite expected content.  
- Examining the code in human mode to identify potential issues with data generation or file writing.

## Tracing data flow  
- The `create_human_interview_prompts()` function attempts to save `ai_context` to `ai_refinement_context.md`.  
- It uses a try-except block to handle potential errors while writing, printing success or failure messages.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is pointing out that the `ai_refinement_context.md` file is blank. Looking at the code, this file should contain the AI-generated responses from the songbird CSV file. Let me check what's happening.


## Investigating File Issue  
- Noticed the `ai_refinement_context.md` file is blank, which seems unusual given its purpose.  
- This file should hold AI-generated responses from the songbird CSV data, so let's figure out why it's empty.  
- Checking if there was an error during generation or if the data wasn't processed correctly.  
- Could be a missing input, failed export, or configuration issue; exploring possible causes next.

## Examining Function Behavior
- The `create_human_interview_prompts()` function uses `load_ai_responses(ai_csv)` to load AI context, which formats the CSV into readable text for the LLM.  
- Found the CSV file has data, so the issue likely lies with how `load_ai_responses` processes it.  
- Noticed the function skips the header and formats rows into a document-like structure, which could fail if the CSV format doesn't match expectations.  
- Exploring whether `load_ai_responses` is failing to read or parse the data correctly, potentially leaving `ai_context` empty.

## Examining Function Behavior  
- The `load_ai_responses` function processes CSV data by extracting categories, questions, and answers into formatted Q&A pairs for the LLM.  
- It organizes content by splitting rows into sections, grouping questions and answers, and formatting them under category headers like "## Category.</details></think>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the issue! The CSV file has very complex, multi-line data in the cells. The AI-generated responses are extremely long and contain line breaks, quotes, and complex formatting. The current `load_ai_responses` function is trying to parse this using simple line splitting, but it's not working correctly because the data is not structured as simple newline-separated values.


## Identifying Data Issues  
- The CSV file contains complex, multi-line data with AI-generated responses that include line breaks and quotes.  
- The current parsing method, using simple line splitting, fails due to the unstructured format of the data.

## Examining CSV Structure  
- The CSV cells contain long text with `<think>` blocks, multiple paragraphs, and detailed reasoning, far beyond simple formats.  
- The data includes embedded quotes and multi-paragraph responses, complicating the expected parsing logic.</details></think>

A: <think> # 🧠 **Personal Reasoning Context** ## Internal Reasoning Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking how I typically approach complex problems. From the knowledge base and chat history, there are a few key points. First, in the SCRIPT section, they mention building frameworks for AGI, emphasizing experimentation and iterative progress. That suggests breaking down big problems into manageable parts. Then, in the

## Resolving the Issue  
- The `ai_refinement_context.md` file is now correctly filled with AI-generated responses from the songbird CSV.  
- The problem has been fully addressed and resolved.</details></think>

---

Perfect! The issue has been fixed. The `ai_refinement_context.md` file is now properly populated with 383,627 characters of AI-generated responses from the songbird CSV file.

## What was wrong:

The `load_ai_responses` function was failing to parse the complex, multi-line AI-generated responses in the CSV. The function was:

1. Concatenating CSV fields with newlines into a single string
2. Then trying to parse it by splitting at newlines
3. But the AI responses contained their own newlines, quotes, and complex formatting
4. This broke the parsing logic that expected exactly 9 lines in a specific format

## The fix:

I modified the function to process the CSV data directly without the intermediate string concatenation. Now it extracts Q&A pairs directly from the CSV row data using the correct column names (`"Human_Answer 1"`, etc.) instead of trying to parse a concatenated string.

## Result:

The human mode now works exactly as you described:
- ✅ Creates initial prompt from human interview data only
- ✅ Refines it using the most recent songbird AI responses  
- ✅ Populates all intermediate files correctly, including `ai_refinement_context.md`

The system maintains the "authentic human foundation" while using AI responses to add deeper insights and refinement, exactly as intended! 🎯
