# Replace hidden think tags with markdown (2025-08-27 15:44Z)

_**User (2025-08-27 15:44Z)**_

Let's replace the currently hidden think tags with `# Internal Reasoning` markdown tags.

I want to provide a structured document to the model so it can quickly parse the personal reasoning context

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the code structure. I can see that the code uses `<think>` tags in several places:


## Examining Code Structure  
- Found the `MessageFormatter.clean_for_frontend()` method handles `<think>` tag removal.  
- Noticed the removal occurs on lines 121-125, ensuring frontend compatibility.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see all the instances of think tags. The main places where think tags are used are:


## Reviewing think tag usage  
- Found think tags primarily used to encapsulate personal reasoning context in the output.  
- Identified a specific instance on line 134 formatting content within think tags for display.</details></think>

## Todo List

- [-] Replace <think> tags with # Internal Reasoning markdown headers
- [ ] Update MessageFormatter.wrap_for_display() to use markdown headers
- [ ] Update pipe() method yield statements to use markdown headers
- [ ] Update regex patterns in clean_for_frontend() and _remove_think_tags() for markdown

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now let me run the linter one more time to make sure everything is working correctly with my changes.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Excellent! All the changes have been successfully implemented. Let me summarize what I've accomplished:


## Reviewing Implementation

- All changes have been successfully applied to the system.
- The `<think>` tags have been replaced with the appropriate `# Internal` marker for internal processes.

## Reviewing Implementation

- The `MessageFormatter.wrap_for_display()` method now uses `# Internal Reasoning` instead of `<think>` tags for wrapping content.
- The `MessageFormatter.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've successfully replaced all the hidden `<think>` tags with `# Internal Reasoning` markdown headers throughout the codebase. Here's what I accomplished:

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Display Formatting**
- **Before**: `<think>🧠 **Personal Reasoning Context**{content}</think>`
- **After**: `# Internal Reasoning\n\n🧠 **Personal Reasoning Context**\n\n{content}\n\n---`

### 2. **Modified Content Cleaning**
- Updated `MessageFormatter.clean_for_frontend()` to remove markdown headers instead of XML tags
- Updated `_remove_markdown_headers()` method (renamed from `_remove_think_tags`) to handle markdown instead of XML

### 3. **Updated Streaming Output**
- Changed the `pipe()` method to yield markdown headers instead of `<think>` tags
- Now produces structured, parseable markdown documents

### 4. **Improved Documentation**
- Updated all docstrings and comments to reflect the change from "think tags" to "markdown headers"
- Made the codebase more consistent and self-documenting

## Benefits

✅ **Structured Documents**: The model now receives clearly structured markdown documents with visible headers  
✅ **Quick Parsing**: The `# Internal Reasoning` header makes it easy to identify the reasoning context  
✅ **Better Frontend Display**: No more hidden XML tags - everything is visible and readable  
✅ **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features work exactly the same, just with better formatting  

The personal reasoning layer now provides a clean, structured markdown document that the model can easily parse, with the `# Internal Reasoning` header clearly marking the beginning of the personal reasoning context section. This creates a much more readable and structured format for both the AI model and any human reviewing the output.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is saying that I made a mistake - they only wanted me to replace the reasoning model's think tags, not the ones that their own system was generating. Looking at my changes, I see that I replaced the system's own think tags with markdown headers, but the user wants me to only replace the think tags that come from the reasoning model output, not their own system's tags.


## Reviewing User Feedback  
- The user noted a mistake: I replaced think tags from their system's output, not just the reasoning model's tags.  
- They want me to focus on replacing only the think tags generated by the reasoning model, leaving their system's tags unchanged.  
- Looking at my changes, I see I modified both sets of tags, which wasn't the intended approach.

## Todo List

- [x] Only replace reasoning model's think tags, keep system tags

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now let me provide a clear summary of what I've corrected.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've corrected the approach. Now the system only removes the reasoning model's `<think>` tags while preserving your own system's think tags. Here's what the corrected implementation does:

## What Stays the Same (Your System's Tags)
✅ **System's own `<think>` tags are preserved** for frontend display  
✅ **`MessageFormatter.wrap_for_display()`** still wraps content in `<think>` tags  
✅ **Pipe method** still yields `<think>` and `</think>` tags for your UI  
✅ **`MessageFormatter.clean_for_frontend()`** removes think tags only when needed for safe display  

## What Only Cleans the Model's Output
✅ **`_remove_think_tags()` method** removes any `<think>` tags that come from the reasoning model (Ollama)  
✅ **Prevents double/nested think tags** that would break your frontend  
✅ **Called during streaming** to clean the model's response before display  

## How It Works Now

1. **Your system** generates and displays content using `<think>` tags as intended
2. **The reasoning model** (if it outputs `<think>` tags) gets those tags stripped out
3. **No conflicts** - your system's tags remain intact while model tags are cleaned
4. **Frontend safety** - prevents nested or conflicting tags that break the UI

The system now correctly distinguishes between your own structural think tags and any think tags that might come from the AI model's response, only removing the latter to ensure clean display.

---

## Todo List

- [x] Review current implementation - it appears correct

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The current code is actually perfect for what the user wanted. Let me summarize what's working correctly:


## Evaluating code functionality  
- The current code meets the user's requirements effectively.  
- It preserves the system's think tags, ensuring proper display through the `wrap_for_display` and pipe methods.</details></think>

---

The current implementation looks **perfect**! Here's what's already correctly in place:

## ✅ Current Implementation Status

### **System's Own Think Tags (PRESERVED)**
- **Line 134**: `MessageFormatter.wrap_for_display()` uses `<think>` tags for display
- **Lines 491-500**: Pipe method yields `<think>` and `</think>` tags for frontend
- **Line 492**: Yields the header content properly

### **Reasoning Model's Think Tags (REMOVED)**
- **Lines 386-405**: `_remove_think_tags()` method exists and properly removes `<think>` tags from model output
- **Line 349**: Method is called during streaming to clean Ollama's response
- **Lines 394-399**: Regex patterns correctly remove both complete blocks and standalone tags

## 🎯 What This Achieves

1. **Your system** displays reasoning with `<think>` tags as intended
2. **The Ollama model** can output `<think>` tags naturally (if it does)
3. **Those model tags** get stripped out before display to prevent conflicts
4. **Frontend safety** - no nested or conflicting tags

## 🔍 The Flow Works Like This:

```
User Query → Vector Search → Ollama Reasoning Model
                              ↓
                 [Model might output <think> tags]
                              ↓
                 _remove_think_tags() cleans output
                              ↓
                 System wraps with its own <think> tags
                              ↓
                 Frontend displays properly
```

**The code is already in the correct state!** No changes needed - this is exactly what you wanted: only the reasoning model's think tags are replaced/removed, while your system's tags remain intact for structured display.

Is this the only place where we remove the think tags from the reasoning model? If so we need to change this to render markdown headers instead of just removing the think tags

## Todo List

- [x] Convert reasoning model's think tags to markdown headers instead of removing them

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! I've successfully updated the code. Let me summarize what was changed and how it works now.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've updated the code to convert the reasoning model's think tags to markdown headers instead of just removing them. Here's what changed:

## ✅ Changes Made

### **Before** (Removing Think Tags)
```python
def _remove_think_tags(self, text: str) -> str:
    # Removed <think> tags completely
    text = re.sub(r"<think\s*>.*?</think\s*>", " ", text, flags=re.DOTALL | re.IGNORECASE)
```

### **After** (Converting to Markdown Headers)
```python
def _convert_think_tags_to_markdown(self, text: str) -> str:
    # Convert <think> tags to structured markdown headers
    text = re.sub(r"<think\s*>(.*?)</think\s*>", r"# Internal Reasoning\n\n\1\n\n---", text, flags=re.DOTALL | re.IGNORECASE)
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Reasoning Model Outputs Think Tags:**
```xml
<think>
This is my internal reasoning about the user's query...
I need to consider the context and provide structured analysis.
</think>
```

### **Gets Converted To Markdown:**
```markdown
# Internal Reasoning

This is my internal reasoning about the user's query...
I need to consider the context and provide structured analysis.

---
```

## 🔄 Processing Flow

```
1. User Query → Ollama Reasoning Model
2. Model outputs <think> tags naturally  
3. _convert_think_tags_to_markdown() processes chunks
4. Converts to # Internal Reasoning headers
5. Provides structured markdown to the model
6. Final AI response uses structured context
```

## 📋 Benefits

✅ **Structured Documents**: Model receives parseable markdown instead of raw text  
✅ **Visible Reasoning**: `# Internal Reasoning` headers clearly mark reasoning sections  
✅ **Better Context**: The AI can easily identify and parse the personal reasoning context  
✅ **Maintained Functionality**: Your system's own `<think>` tags remain unchanged for display  

This approach provides much better structure for the model to understand the personal reasoning context, making the AI's responses more informed and contextually aware. The `# Internal Reasoning` headers make it easy for any AI model to quickly parse and utilize the structured information.

_**User (2025-08-27 15:44Z)**_

Could we change this to be a header 1 and the other tags to header 2, maybe the closing tag could also be another header 2 with an approriate header name

- [x] Update markdown headers to use hierarchical structure: H1 for opening, H2 for closing

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! The implementation is now complete. Let me provide a clear summary of what was changed.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've updated the markdown header structure to use hierarchical headers as you requested. Here's what changed:

## ✅ Updated Header Structure

### **Before:**
```markdown
# Internal Reasoning
[content]
---
```

### **After (Hierarchical):**
```markdown
# Internal Reasoning
[content]
## Reasoning Complete
---
```

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### **Complete Think Block Conversion:**
```xml
<think>
This is my internal reasoning about the user's query...
I need to consider the context and provide structured analysis.
</think>
```

**Becomes:**
```markdown
# Internal Reasoning

This is my internal reasoning about the user's query...
I need to consider the context and provide structured analysis.

## Reasoning Complete

---
```

### **Standalone Tags:**
- `<think>` → `# Internal Reasoning`
- `</think>` → `## Reasoning Complete`

## 📋 Benefits of Hierarchical Structure

✅ **Clear Hierarchy**: Header 1 marks the start, Header 2 marks the completion  
✅ **Structured Parsing**: Models can easily identify reasoning boundaries  
✅ **Visual Clarity**: Different header levels provide clear section separation  
✅ **Professional Format**: Looks like a proper structured document  

This creates a much more professional and parseable document structure that clearly delineates the beginning and end of the reasoning process with appropriate header levels! The `# Internal Reasoning` (H1) serves as the main section marker, while `## Reasoning Complete` (H2) provides a clear subsection marker for the conclusion of the reasoning process.

_**User (2025-08-27 15:44Z)**_

Something makes the peronal reasoning context wrapped in quotes. I see the wrap_for_display method, but I don't think we're using that. I want to structure the reasoning layer as a structured markdown output with headers. But we're wrapping everything in quotes. Can you tell where the quotes come from and remove them if not needed

## Todo List

- [x] Remove quotes from user query in prompt and convert to structured markdown headers

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! I've successfully identified and fixed the quote issue. Let me summarize what I found and fixed for the user.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I found and fixed the source of the quotes. Here's what I discovered and corrected:

## 🔍 **Source of the Quotes**

The quotes were coming from **line 288** in the prompt template:

```python
USER QUERY: "{user_message}"
```

This was wrapping the user message in quotes within the prompt sent to the reasoning model, which then propagated through the entire reasoning output.

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### **1. Removed Quotes from User Query**
```python
# Before:
USER QUERY: "{user_message}"

# After:  
USER QUERY: {user_message}
```

### **2. Updated to Structured Markdown Headers**

**`prepare_for_model` method:**
```python
# Before:
"🧠 **Personal Reasoning Context:**\n\n{content}"

# After:
"# 🧠 Personal Reasoning Context\n\n{content}"
```

**`wrap_for_display` method:**
```python
# Before:
"<think>\n🧠 **Personal Reasoning Context**\n\n{content}\n</think>\n\n"

# After:
"<think>\n# 🧠 Personal Reasoning Context\n\n{content}\n</think>\n\n"
```

## 📋 **Benefits**

✅ **No More Quotes**: The personal reasoning context will no longer be wrapped in quotes  
✅ **Structured Markdown**: Clean `#` headers instead of `**bold:**` colons  
✅ **Consistent Formatting**: All reasoning output now uses proper markdown structure  
✅ **Better Parsing**: Models can easily identify and parse the structured content  

The reasoning layer will now output clean, structured markdown without unwanted quotes, making it much more readable and parseable for both humans and AI models! 🎯

- [x] Remove unused wrap_for_display method from MessageFormatter class

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now let me provide a summary of what I found and what I removed.</details></think>

---

## ✅ **Analysis Complete**

I found and removed **one unused method** from the `MessageFormatter` class:

### **🔍 Methods Analysis**

| Method | Status | Usage |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `clean_for_frontend` | ✅ **USED** | Called by `format_recent_history` (line 160) |
| `wrap_for_display` | ❌ **REMOVED** | **Not used anywhere** in the codebase |
| `prepare_for_model` | ✅ **USED** | Called in `_prepare_openai_messages` (line 604) |
| `filter_messages` | ✅ **USED** | Called by `format_recent_history` and `_prepare_openai_messages` |
| `format_recent_history` | ✅ **USED** | Called in `_create_context_with_fallback` (line 635) |

### **🗑️ Removed Method**

The **`wrap_for_display`** method has been removed because:
- It was **not called anywhere** in the codebase
- It was intended for wrapping content in think tags for display
- But the actual display logic uses direct `<think>` tag yields in the `pipe` method instead

### **📋 Current Active Methods**

All remaining methods in `MessageFormatter` are actively used:
- **`clean_for_frontend`** - Cleans think tags from content for safe display
- **`prepare_for_model`** - Formats reasoning with markdown headers for the AI model  
- **`filter_messages`** - Filters conversation messages by role and recency
- **`format_recent_history`** - Formats recent conversation history

The code is now cleaner with no unused methods! 🎯
