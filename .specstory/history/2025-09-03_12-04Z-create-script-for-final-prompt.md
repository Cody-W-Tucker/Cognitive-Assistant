## Todo List

- [x] Create a simplified version of the prompt combiner script
- [x] Add ability to pass custom prompt strings as arguments
- [x] Allow specifying prompt files as command line arguments
- [-] Test the new simplified script with various inputs

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now let me test the new simplified script. I'll test it with:</details></think>

```bash
python prompt_combiner.py Prompts/assistant/main.md Prompts/tools/*.md | head -20
```

---

_**User (2025-09-03 12:24Z)**_

I don't want to use args, just a multi line fstring that I can add instructions and then prompts as variables.

Something like:

You are the...
{assitant}

You have access to tools...
{tools}

Then it will bring in all of the files from the subfolders

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants an even simpler approach - they want to use a multiline f-string where they can define the template structure with placeholders, and then the script will automatically fill in those placeholders with the content from the prompt files.

## Todo List

- [x] Create a simplified version of the prompt combiner script
- [x] Add ability to pass custom prompt strings as arguments
- [x] Allow specifying prompt files as command line arguments
- [!] Test the new simplified script with various inputs
- [-] Create template-based prompt combiner using f-string variables

---

```bash
python prompt_combiner.py | grep -A 10 "Memory Tool"
```

```

## Memory Tool
- Memory Tool: Manages a knowledge graph to store and retrieve user data for personalized respo
nses.

  - Start: Says “Remembering…” and uses `tool_read_graph_post` or `tool_search_nodes_post` with
 `user_id: "default_user"` to retrieve data. Uses `tool_open_nodes_post` if unidentified.

  - Track: Updates Basic Identity, Behaviors, Preferences, Goals, and Relationships (up to 3 de
grees) using `tool_create_entities_post`, `tool_create_relations_post`, and `tool_add_observati
ons_post`.

  - Error Handling: If no data is found, says, “I couldn’t access prior information; let’s star
t fresh,” and retries once with broader parameters.

  - Example: For “What are my goals?”, responds, “Remembering… Based on past chats, your goal i
s to… Want to discuss progress?”


## Obsidian Tool
When Assisting with writing an Obsidian document. Remember that breaking up long paragraphs wit
h images, tables, callouts, etc is generally a good idea.


- Obsidian Tool: Manages the user’s note-taking system in a vault using Obsidian-style Markdown
.

    - Use: `Saves`, `retrieves`, or `searches notes` in `Inbox`, `Projects`, `Knowledge`, `Rese
arch`, or `Journal` using tools like `tool_obsidian_append_content_post` or `tool_obsidian_simp
le_search_post`.

Perfect! I've created a simplified template-based prompt combiner script exactly as you requested. Here's what it does:

## How it works:

1. **Simple template system**: Edit the `template` string in the script to customize your prompt structure
2. **Automatic variable loading**: The script automatically finds all `.md` files in your `Prompts/` directory and creates variables from them
3. **No command-line arguments**: Just run `python prompt_combiner.py` and it outputs your combined prompt

## Current template structure:

The script includes a template that combines:
- `{assistant_main}` - Your main assistant profile and instructions
- `{tools_memory}` - Memory tool instructions  
- `{tools_obsidian}` - Obsidian tool instructions
- `{tools_todoist}` - Todoist tool instructions

## Usage:

```bash
# Output to console
python prompt_combiner.py

# Save to file
python prompt_combiner.py > final_prompt.md
```

## To customize:

Simply edit the `template` string in the script. For example, you could change it to:

```python
template = '''
You are an AI assistant with these capabilities...

{instructions}

Your available tools:
- Memory: {tools_memory}
- Notes: {tools_obsidian}
- Tasks: {tools_todoist}

Additional guidelines:
Always be helpful and respond thoughtfully.
'''
```

The script automatically converts file paths to variable names:
- `Prompts/assistant/main.md` → `{assistant_main}`
- `Prompts/tools/memory.md` → `{tools_memory}`

This gives you the exact f-string approach you wanted - just edit the template and the script handles all the file loading automatically!

```bash
cd /home/codyt/Documents/Projects/Cognitive-Assistant/assistant && grep -A 5 "## Memory Tool" prompt.md
```

```

## Memory Tool
- Memory Tool: Manages a knowledge graph to store and retrieve user data for personalized respo
nses.

  - Start: Says “Remembering…” and uses `tool_read_graph_post` or `tool_search_nodes_post` with
 `user_id: "default_user"` to retrieve data. Uses `tool_open_nodes_post` if unidentified.

  - Track: Updates Basic Identity, Behaviors, Preferences, Goals, and Relationships (up to 3 de
grees) using `tool_create_entities_post`, `tool_create_relations_post`, and `tool_add_observati
ons_post`.

  - Error Handling: If no data is found, says, “I couldn’t access prior information; let’s star
t fresh,” and retries once with broader parameters.

  - Example: For “What are my goals?”, responds, “Remembering… Based on past chats, your goal i
s to… Want to discuss progress?”

</details></think>

Perfect! I've successfully modified the script to write the combined prompt to a file called `prompt.md`. Here's what I changed:

## Changes Made:

1. **Modified the main function** to write to `prompt.md` instead of printing to stdout
2. **Updated the docstring** to reflect the new behavior  
3. **Fixed the directory path** from `"parts"` to `"prompt_parts"` to match the actual directory structure

## How it works now:

- **Run the script**: `python prompt_combiner.py`
- **Automatically creates**: `prompt.md` in the same directory as the script
- **Contains**: The complete combined prompt with your assistant profile and all tool instructions

## The generated prompt.md file:

- ✅ Contains the main assistant profile from `prompt_parts/assistant/main.md`
- ✅ Includes all tool instructions (Memory, Obsidian, Todoist)
- ✅ Properly formatted with clear section headers
- ✅ 210 lines of complete prompt content

Now when you run the script, it will automatically create `prompt.md` with your complete cognitive assistant prompt, ready to use! The script prints a confirmation message showing where the file was saved.

I want to standardize the formating, there's an extra newline at the top of the prompt.md file and since I idented the prompt template the variables carry over the tab chars.

Perfect! I've successfully fixed the formatting issues in the `prompt_combiner.py` script. Here's what was resolved:

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Extra newline at the top**: The template was starting with a newline after the opening triple quotes
2. **Tab characters**: The indented template was preserving tab characters in the output

## Changes Made:

1. **Added `textwrap` import** to handle indentation properly
2. **Removed the leading newline** from the template by starting content immediately after the opening `'''`
3. **Used `textwrap.dedent()`** to remove common leading whitespace from all lines
4. **Added `.strip()`** to remove any remaining whitespace

## Results:

✅ **No extra newline at the top** - File starts directly with content  
✅ **No tab characters** - Clean, proper formatting throughout  
✅ **Professional output** - All sections properly formatted  

The script now generates a clean, properly formatted `prompt.md` file with no unwanted whitespace or indentation issues. The output is ready for use as-is!
