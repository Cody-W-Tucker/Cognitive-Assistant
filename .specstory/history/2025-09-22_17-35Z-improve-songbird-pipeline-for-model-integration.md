# Improve songbird pipeline for model integration (2025-09-22 17:35Z)

_**User (2025-09-22 17:27Z)**_

Let's improve the songbird pipeline to send the RAG docs to the frontier model also instead of just the Ollama model.

Should we also truncate the docs to Ollama model to not overwhelm, but then send the full docs to frontier?

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to improve the songbird pipeline to send RAG docs to the frontier model (in addition to the Ollama model). They also ask about truncating docs for Ollama but sending full docs to the frontier model.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I understand the current songbird pipeline. Let me analyze what it does:


## Examining Songbird Pipeline  
- The pipeline uses Ollama to create personal reasoning context based on RAG docs.  
- These RAG docs are sourced from Qdrant for generating relevant thinking.

## Examining Songbird Pipeline  
- RAG docs are processed in `_gather_vector_context` to form a knowledge context prompt for Ollama.  
- Ollama generates reasoning content, tagged with `<think>`, which is streamed for further use.</details></think>

## Todo List

- [-] Modify _stream_personal_reasoning_context to create truncated docs for Ollama reasoning
- [ ] Update frontier model prompt to include full RAG docs alongside reasoning
- [ ] Create a helper method to truncate docs intelligently for Ollama
- [ ] Test that both truncated and full docs are properly handled

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Let me start by creating a helper method to truncate docs for Ollama, then modify the reasoning context method to use truncated docs, and finally update the frontier model prompt to include full docs.

## ‚úÖ Songbird Pipeline Enhanced

I've successfully improved the songbird pipeline to send RAG docs to both the Ollama model (truncated) and the frontier model (full docs). Here's what was implemented:

### Key Changes:

1. **Added Doc Truncation for Ollama**: Created `_truncate_docs_for_reasoning()` method that:
   - Sorts docs by relevance score and takes top 10 most relevant
   - Limits each doc to ~800 characters (keeping the most important beginning)
   - Caps total context at 4000 characters to avoid overwhelming Ollama
   - Focuses on quality over quantity for reasoning

2. **Added Full Docs for Frontier Model**: Created `_format_full_docs_for_frontier()` method that:
   - Includes complete RAG docs with scores and metadata
   - Provides comprehensive context for the frontier model to work with

3. **Updated Context Class**: Added `full_docs_context` field to store the complete docs for the frontier model

4. **Enhanced Message Preparation**: Modified `_prepare_openai_messages()` to include both:
   - Truncated reasoning context (from Ollama) 
   - Full RAG docs (for frontier model)

### How It Works Now:

1. **Ollama Reasoning**: Gets truncated, focused context (~4000 chars max) to generate personal reasoning without being overwhelmed
2. **Frontier Model**: Receives both the Ollama-generated reasoning AND the complete RAG docs for maximum context and accuracy

The pipeline now provides the best of both worlds - efficient reasoning from Ollama with focused context, and comprehensive information access for the frontier model to generate the final response.

All syntax checks pass and the implementation is ready for testing! üöÄ
