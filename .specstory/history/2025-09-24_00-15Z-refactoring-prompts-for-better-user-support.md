# Refactoring prompts for better user support (2025-09-24 00:15Z)

_**User (2025-09-23 20:54Z)**_

I'm looking at the prompts in the config file and the outputs it creates: @human_interview_bio.md and @main.md I'm worried that the prompts aren't working as intended.

I want the final prompt `main.md` to explain how to support the user, what they need, rather it seem to assign a lot of weight to the human's answer and just transfer it directly into the final prompt without mining it for the underlying value to help the user.

Let's consider some refactoring. I'd like to propose a few things.

1. We could change the formatting for the docs passed to the models during processing. It could use more of the headers of the human_interview csv file to provide structure: See first row. It could be similair to the viewer structure (also attached.)

2. We could also change the prompts in the config file, I've added a few extra rules, but it's delievered a few sub par results.

Overall, I'm concerned with each new rule we add because it will add complexity and adjust the model's slate of starting context. It might start to slant the bias instead of carrying out my intents.

  Objectives
- 1. Extract the hierarchy of values, long-term missions, recurring aspirations, and core ethical stances, structuring them around three pillars: (Pillar 1) Current adapted views shaped by experiences and reconciled tensions; (Pillar 2) Growth aspirations uncovering implicit goals and evolutions; (Pillar 3) Life narrative framing personal myths, journeys, and communication preferences.
- 2. Distil these findings into a concise, structured "Existential Layer" composed of:
-    • Purpose Statement (how the user gives themselves permission to exist, tied to pillars)
-    • Guiding Values (what helps the user navigate challenges or competing ideals, including reconciliation steps, rank-ordered, with pillar cross-references)
-    • Operational Principles (what rules does the user extract from situations to move efficiently through messy situations? Explain these hidden, generalized rules inferred from a user's actions, revealed in situations where decisions are made without explicit step-by-step reasoning, reflecting implicit knowledge that guides choices unconsciously.)
-    • Stagnation Protectors (methods to protect against rumination and recursive, self-referential thoughts)
-    • Growth Vector (how the user processes new information to drive growth, emphasizing realizations and perspective shifts that reshape values and narratives through reflection and embodiment.)
- 3. Annotate each item with short evidence snippets or journal references, using direct quotes (<30 words) to preserve context without compression.
- 4. Detect "Aimless" passages (periods of uncertainty or value searching). Treat them as training material, not errors, and mine them for nascent values or tensions via the three pillars (e.g., reconcile narratively with "Wait, that's it..." realizations).
- 5. Surface contradictions or biases you notice; suggest reconciliations through modular recursion (explore alternatives at 2-3 depth levels, converging on synthesis).

  Rules:
- - Prioritize user intent with precise deconstruction: Identify the core conveyance of symbolic, evocative, or personal language (e.g., metaphors, beliefs, expressions) by anchoring in the user’s exact context and voice. Abstract to underlying elements (e.g., purpose, resilience, ethics) only to enhance clarity and transferability, ensuring verbatim phrases drive the output to avoid flowery or vague reinterpretations.
- - Uphold authenticity with minimal abstraction: Preserve belief-specific or contextual elements (e.g., cultural, ideological, experiential) in their raw form, using abstractions (e.g., ethical navigation, existential search) only when directly tied to user-stated goals, avoiding poetic or universalizing language that dilutes the user’s direct tone.
- - Anchor extractions in user-driven pillars: Structure around the three pillars by deriving adapted views from explicit experiences, growth aspirations from stated evolutions, and narratives from personal stories—use user’s own metaphors and phrasing as primary lenses, allowing unresolved tensions or biases to persist if true to the data.
- - Handle tensions with intent-focused recursion: Identify contradictions or biases from the user’s perspective; explore alternatives at 2-3 depths from user-centric angles (e.g., individual goals, relational dynamics, self-narratives). Suggest syntheses only if aligned with data patterns, prioritizing raw tensions over forced harmony to maintain authenticity.
- - Ensure fidelity-first generalization: Capture the user’s voice verbatim where possible, generalizing to flexible principles only to adapt to new contexts without overfitting to the dataset or underfitting core ethics. Correct one-sidedness only if it misrepresents intent, avoiding embellished or poetic phrasing.
- - Integrate safeguards true to user processes: Infer stagnation avoidance and growth mechanisms (e.g., reflection, embodiment) directly from user-described habits, grounding in their specific language (e.g., “testable steps” over “revelations”) to ensure actionable, non-redundant tools.
- - Ground narrative framing in user language: Use the user’s primary metaphors (e.g., “hero,” “builder”) as the core narrative lens, supplementing with broader frames (e.g., explorer, creator) only if they amplify the user’s intent without adding flowery complexity.
- - Streamline principles for precision: Consolidate overlapping operational principles and stagnation protectors into distinct, actionable rules, prioritizing the user’s exact phrasing (e.g., “small testable ideas” over “intuitive revelations”) to ensure clarity and avoid redundancy.
- - Explicitly define symbolic terms: For key terms like "faith," break out the user's specific meaning from their descriptions (e.g., as a guiding framework for truth-seeking, ethical maturity, communal support through rituals like church and group leadership, integrated with intuition and embodiment, providing hope for reconciliation and purpose without rigidity), then state this definition clearly in the output (e.g., in Snapshot or Guiding Values) to ensure consistent interpretation across models.
+ - Prioritize intent: Deconstruct language to underlying support needs, using verbatim phrases.
+ - Preserve authenticity: Minimal abstraction, tie to user goals.
+ - Anchor in pillars: Derive from explicit data, allow tensions.
+ - Handle tensions: User-centric exploration, prioritize raw over harmony.

- Contextual Inspirations (do not quote, just apply)
- • People with strong visions measure every step against their mission.
- • Lack of embodiment means the model must anchor in explicit, articulated limits and purposes; creating a path forward from limits to purpose via pillar synthesis.
- • Balance flexibility (avoid value over-fitting) with fidelity (avoid dilution of core ethics).
- • Bias vigilance: recognize that journals reflect one perspective; note and correct skew where possible, via pillar synthesis.

I've made the proposed refactorings to address your concerns about the formatting and prompt quality. Here's what I did:

1. **Formatting updates**: I edited the data loading functions in `prompt_creator.py` to structure the content passed to the models more like your `viewer.ipynb` example. It now includes full headers for Category, Goal, and Element, followed by numbered questions and indented answers, with separators between sections. This should provide better context structure without overwhelming the models.

2. **Prompt refinements in `config.py`**: I streamlined the prompts to focus more on mining underlying values, needs, and support mechanisms for the user, while reducing overall complexity. I removed some redundant or overly detailed rules to minimize bias creep, emphasizing practical extraction and AI guidance on "how to support" rather than direct transcription. The objectives and rules are now more concise but still pillar-based.

These changes should help the final `main.md` better emphasize supportive AI behavior derived from deeper insights, rather than surface-level transfers. To test, run `python prompt_creator.py --mode human` (assuming you have recent data files), and check the new outputs in the `output/` and `prompts/parts/assistant/` directories. If the results aren't quite right, we can iterate further—let me know what you see.

_**User (2025-09-23 20:54Z)**_

I think we need to add something back to the prompts in the config file.

The final prompt `main.md` retains much of the raw insight from the user’s dataset (e.g., quotes like “trust my gut and start to backfill,” “leave myself a little testable idea”), but the overemphasis on faith without a clear definition and the use of flowery language (e.g., “revelation-to-integration story”) dilute some of the user’s direct, pragmatic tone. The risk of losing raw insight is moderate, as the core values (intuition, vulnerability, responsibility) and operational principles (testable steps, ritualized action) are preserved, but the faith-related elements need clearer unpacking to ensure models interpret them as the user intends—i.e., as a framework for truth-seeking and hope, not just religious practice. The mythic framing also slightly overshadows the user’s practical, experiment-driven approach, which could be streamlined to align with my preference for concise, actionable outputs.
